### 3.1. Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
_Figure 3.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of ToLuist.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of five components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) renders the GUI of the app.
* [**`Dispatcher`**](#dispatcher-component) invokes a suitable command executor.
* [**`Controller`**](#logic-component) executes the command.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) holds the data of the application in the memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the five components defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.

Our architecture follows the *Model-View-Controller* (MVC) Pattern. UI displays data and interacts with the user. Commands are passed through 
the Dispatcher and routed to a suitable Controller. Controller receives requests from the Dispatcher and acts as the 
bridge between the UI and the Model. Model & Storage store and maintain the data. A lot of inspirations for this design
 was drawn from MVC architectures used by web MVC frameworks such as [Ruby on Rails](http://paulhan221.tumblr.com/post/114731592051/rails-http-requests-for-mvc) and [Laravel](http://laravelbook.com/laravel-architecture/).

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2. UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="600"><br>
_Figure 3.2 : Structure of the UI Component_

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/toluist/ui/Ui.java)

**JavaFX** is used for the UI. `MainWindow` holds all the views that make up the different parts of the UI. These views inherit from the abstract `UiView` class, while `MainWindow` itself inherits from the abstract `UiPart` class.

#### 3.2.1. UiView

**API** : [`UiView.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/toluist/ui/view/UiView.java)

`UiView` is the building block for the UI. Each `UiView` should preferably be responsible for only one UI functionality.

Some of the key properties of a `UiView` are described below.

#### Associated with a FXML
Each UIView class is associated with a FXML file. For example, `TaskView` is associated with `TaskView.fxml` file. The corresponding FXML file will be loaded automatically when a new `UiView` instance is created.

#### Attachable to one single parent node
You can attach a `UiView` to a parent node. At any point of time, a `UiView` should always have a maximum of one parent. The parent node must be an object of `Pane` class or any of its subclasses.

#### Rendered idempotently

After attaching a `UiView` to a parent node, you can render it by invoking its public method `render()`. Each render call is guaranteed to be idempotent, i.e. subsequent calls to `render()` will render the same UI, as long as the data do not change.

#### Able to load subviews

Each `UiView` has a mini lifecycle. `viewDidLoad` is run after `render` is called. There are a few uses of `viewDidLoad`:

- Control UI-specific properties which cannot be done in FXML.
- Set UI component values (e.g. using `setText` on an FXML `Text` object).
- Attach subviews and propagate the chain.

#### 3.2.2. UiStore ####

**API** : [`UiStore.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/toluist/ui/UiStore.java)

`UiStore` holds the data to be used by the `Ui`. An example would be the task data to be displayed to the user. In essence, `UiStore` acts as a **View Model** for the `Ui`. 

#### 3.2.3. Reactive nature of the UI ####

To keep the UI predictable and to reduce the number of lines of codes used to dictate how the UI should change based on state changes, we make use of reactive programming in our UI. You can declare how the UI should be rendered based solely on the states held by the `UiStore`. `Ui` and `UiStore` together implement the **Observer-Observable** pattern where the `Ui` will listen directly to changes in `UiStore` and re-render automatically.

The diagram below shows how the UI reacts when an add command is called. The UI simply needs to display all the tasks available in the `UiStore`, without knowing what was the exact change.

<img src="images/UiSequence.png" width="600"><br>
_Figure 3.2.3 : Interactions Inside the UI for the `add study` Command_

The reactive approach is borrowed from modern Javascript front-end frameworks such as [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html).

### 3.3. Dispatcher component

**API** : [`Dispatcher.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/toluist/dispatcher/Dispatcher.java)

`Dispatcher` acts like a router in a traditional Web MVC architecture. On receiving new input from the UI, `Dispatcher` decides which `Controller` is the best candidate to handle the input, then instantiates and asks the `Controller` object to execute the command. In effect, `Dispatcher` is implementing the **Facade**, shielding the command logic from the Ui.

### 3.4. Controller component

<img src="images/ControllerClassDiagram.png" width="600"><br>
_Figure 3.4 : Structure of the Controller Component_

**API** : [`Controller.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/toluist/controller/Controller.java)

`Controller` has a `execute` method to execute the command passed by the dispatcher. The command execution can affect the `Model`, the `Storage` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the dispatcher. After every `execute` invocation, `Controller` can optionally set new states in the `UiStore`, which subsequently trigger a Ui re-render.

Each command is represented by a different Controller class, which all extends from the abstract `Controller` class. Hence, `Controller` is implementing the `Command` pattern.

### 3.5. Model component

**API** : [`TodoList.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/toluist/model/TodoList.java)

The `Model` stores the task data for the app inside the memory.

### 3.6. Storage component

**API** : [`TodoListStorage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/toluist/storage/TodoListStorage.java)

The `Storage` component
- acts like a database in the application.
- provides read/write funcionalities to the `Model`, encapsuling all the inner implementation details.
- can save the task data in json format and read it back.
- holds the history of all data changes

#### Undoable History

`undoHistoryStack` hold the serialized json strings of the task list data. The minimum size of this stack is 
always 1. The json string at the top of the stack is the serialization of the current todo list data.

To undo the most recent changes, we simply pop the irrelevant strings in `undoHistoryStack` and then deserialize the json string at the top of the stack into task list data.

An alternative approach to implementing undoable history is to create a `unexecute` method for each mutating 
command, 
and have a local 
history 
of the data changes in each Controller instance. Compared to this alternative, storing a centralized history of data 
changes in the storage is much more robust, as we can avoid checking every Controller instance to 
get the previous data state. An additional benefit is that the integrity of the data change order is guaranteed in 
the `undoHistoryStack`, and we do not need to keep track of what the previous mutating commands were.

**Trello**

Pros:

* Geared towards task management.
* Intuitive UI that gives an overview of a different task in a pipeline.
* Support collaboration on the task board.

Cons:

* Does not have good calendar integration.
* Cannot be used offline.
* Certain operations requires clicking (e.g. dragging and dropping tasks between list), which is not what Jim wants.

### 3.8. Complete or Make Incomplete a Task : `mark`

For when you need to indicate that a task is finished or not.<br>
Marks a task to be complete or incomplete. <br>
Format: `mark [complete/incomplete] INDEX(ES)`

> * Using complete as a parameter will mark the selected task(s) as complete.
> * Using incomplete as a parameter will mark the selected task(s) as incomplete.
> * Using neither will default the command to mark as complete.
> * Supports marking of multiple indexes in a single command.

Example:
* `mark complete 1` <br>
  Marks task 1 as complete.
* `mark incomplete 2` <br>
  Marks task 2 as incomplete.
* `mark 3` <br>
  Marks task 3 as complete.
* `mark 3 -`<br>
  Marks tasks from 3rd to last in the todo list as complete.
* `mark incomplete - 5`<br>
  Marks tasks from first to 5th task in the todo list as incomplete.
* `mark 5, - 3, 7-8 10, 12 -`<br>
  Marks tasks from 1st to 3rd, 5th, 7th, 8th, 10th, and from 12th to last task in the todo list as complete.

### 3.12. Undo a command : `undo`

For when you accidentally entered a wrong command.<br>
Undoes previous commands by the user.<br>
Format: `undo [NUMBER]`

> * `Undo` allows reverting of modifications to the tasks in the todo list. This means that commands like 
`add`, `update`, `delete`, `clear`, `tag`, `untag` and `mark` which modifies the tasks can be reversed with
> `undo`. If loading a different data file with `load` cause the current tasks to be changed, you can go back
> to the previous task using `undo` too (Using `undo`, however, won't revert the change of data storage 
path. It's not considered modifications to the task).
> Changes that are not modifications to the tasks in the todo list cannot be reversed with `undo`. However, 
> you can still easily revert their effects:
>   * Change of storage path location (due to `save` / `load` ) - You can change your storage path to the 
previous location with `save`.
>   * Setting of aliases (due to `alias`) - You can remove the alias with `unalias`.
>   * Removal of aliases (due to `unalias`) - You can set back the alias with `alias`.
>
> * Note that commands that commands that do not modifies the content of the todo list cannot be undone with 
> `undo`. E.g
> * If a number is entered, undoes that amount of previous commands instead.
> * You can also use key combination <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> to quickly undo one time.

Examples:

* `add Test`<br>
  `undo`<br>
  Undo adding Test to the todo list.
* `add Assignment` <br>
  `add Project` <br>
  `undo 2`<br>
  Undo both commands.
* `add Test`<br>
  `Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd>` <br>
  Undo adding Test to the todo list.

### 3.13. Redo a command : `redo`

For when you accidentally undo a correct command.<br>
Redo previously undone commands by the user.<br>
Format: `redo [NUMBER]`

> * Similar to `undo`, `redo` will help you re-apply modifications to the tasks in the todo list that 
> * you mistakenly revoked (using `undo`).<br>
> * If a number is entered, redo that amount of previous commands instead.<br>
> * The number must be less than or equal to the number of commands undone.
> * You can also use key combination <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Y</kbd> to quickly redo one time.

Examples:

* `add Test`<br>
  `undo`<br>
  `redo` <br>
  Redo adding Test to the todo list.
* `add Assignment` <br>
  `add Project`<br>
  `undo 2`<br>
  `redo`<br>
  Redo `add Assignment`.
* `add Test`<br>
  `undo`<br>
  `Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Y</kbd>` <br>
  Redo adding Test to the todo list.

```
