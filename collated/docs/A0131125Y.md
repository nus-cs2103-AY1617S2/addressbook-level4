### 3.1. Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
**Figure 3.1**: Architecture Diagram

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of ToLuist.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for

* Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other during app launch.
* Shutting down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary when exiting the app.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of five components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) renders the GUI of the app.
* [**`Dispatcher`**](#dispatcher-component) invokes a suitable command executor.
* [**`Controller`**](#logic-component) executes the command.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) holds the data of the application in the memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Our architecture follows the *Model-View-Controller* (MVC) Pattern. UI displays data and interacts with the user. Commands are passed through 
the Dispatcher and routed to a suitable Controller. Controller receives requests from the Dispatcher and acts as the 
bridge between the UI and the Model. Model & Storage store and maintain the data. Inspirations for this design
 came from MVC architectures used by web MVC frameworks such as [Ruby on Rails](http://paulhan221.tumblr
 .com/post/114731592051/rails-http-requests-for-mvc) and [Laravel](http://laravelbook.com/laravel-architecture/).

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2. UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="600"><br>
**Figure 3.2**: Structure of the UI Component

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/toluist/ui/Ui.java)

**JavaFX** is used for the UI. `MainWindow` holds all the views that make up the different parts of the UI. These views inherit from the abstract `UiView` class, while `MainWindow` itself inherits from the abstract `UiPart` class.

#### 3.2.1. UiView

**API** : [`UiView.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/toluist/ui/view/UiView.java)

`UiView` is the building block for the UI. Each `UiView` should preferably be responsible for only one UI functionality.

Some of the key properties of a `UiView` are described below.

#### Associated with a FXML
Each UIView class is associated with a FXML file. For example, `TaskView` is associated with `TaskView.fxml` file. The corresponding FXML file will be loaded automatically when a new `UiView` instance is created.

#### Attachable to one single parent node
You can attach a `UiView` to a parent node. At any point of time, a `UiView` should always have a maximum of one parent. The parent node must be an object of `Pane` class or any of its subclasses.

#### Rendered idempotently

After attaching a `UiView` to a parent node, you can render it by invoking its public method `render()`. Each render call is guaranteed to be idempotent, i.e. subsequent calls to `render()` will render the same UI, as long as the data do not change.

#### Able to load subviews

Each `UiView` has a mini lifecycle. `viewDidLoad` is run after `render` is called. There are a few uses of `viewDidLoad`:

- Control UI-specific properties which cannot be done in FXML.
- Set UI component values (e.g. using `setText` on an FXML `Text` object).
- Attach subviews and propagate the chain.

#### 3.2.2. UiStore ####

**API** : [`UiStore.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/toluist/ui/UiStore.java)

`UiStore` holds the data to be used by the `Ui`. An example would be the task data to be displayed to the user.
 
In essence, `UiStore` acts as a **View Model** for the `Ui`. The reason why `UiStore` is separate from the 
`Model` is because a lot of the states used in the `UiStore` are Ui-specific states. Having them separate 
allows having a clear separation of concern between ui states and business logic states.

Since `UiStore` acts as a single universal state container for the Ui, it also implement the *Singleton* 
pattern.

#### 3.2.3. Reactive nature of the UI ####

To keep the Ui predictable and to reduce the number of lines of codes used to dictate how the UI should 
change based on state changes, we make use of reactive programming in our UI.
 
You can declare how the Ui should be rendered based solely on the states held by the `UiStore`. `Ui` and 
`UiStore` together implement the **Observer-Observable** pattern where the `Ui` will listen directly to changes in `UiStore` and re-render automatically.

To make an `UiView` object listen to changes to from a state in `UiStore`, you can use the `bind` API 
provided by `UiStore`. For example, `ResultView` is bound to the observable property 
`observableCommandResult` of `UiStore` with `uiStore.bind(resultView, uiStore.getObservableCommandResult())
`. This way, whenever the command result changes in `UiStore`, the result view will re-render itself.

The diagram below shows how `Ui` reacts when an add command is called. The UI 
simply needs to display all the tasks available in the `UiStore`, without knowing what was the exact change.

<img src="images/UiSequence.png" width="600"><br>
**Figure 3.2.3**: Interactions Inside the UI for the `add study` Command_

The reactive approach is borrowed from modern Javascript front-end frameworks such as [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html).

### 3.3. Dispatcher component

**API** : [`Dispatcher.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/toluist/dispatcher/Dispatcher.java)

`Dispatcher` acts like a router in a traditional Web MVC architecture. On receiving new input from the UI, `Dispatcher` decides which `Controller` is the best candidate to handle the input, then instantiates and asks the `Controller` object to execute the command.
 
In effect, `Dispatcher` is implementing the **Facade**, shielding the command logic from the Ui.

### 3.4. Controller component

<img src="images/ControllerClassDiagram.png" width="600"><br>
**Figure 3.4**: Structure of the Controller Component

**API** : [`Controller.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/toluist/controller/Controller.java)

`Controller` has an `execute` method to execute the command passed by the dispatcher. The command execution
 can affect the `Model`, the `Storage` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the dispatcher. After every `execute` invocation, `Controller` can optionally set new states in the `UiStore`, which subsequently trigger a Ui re-render.

Each command is represented by a different Controller class, which all extends from the abstract 
`Controller` class. The `Controller` is implementing the `Command` pattern, where each `Controller` class 
carries the functionality of a different command.

Some other interesting properties of `Controller` are described below.

#### 3.4.1. Responsible for its own tokenization

As opposed to having central `Tokenizer` or `Parser` class to decide how to tokenize all the different 
commands, each `Controller` provides its own implementation for `tokenize`. This is more modular than 
having a single `Tokenizer` class, as different commands can have very different formats, leading to very 
different tokenization logics in the corresponding `Controller` classes (Though if the logics are similar, 
they can be shared through a helper class).

In effect, this is applying `Open Closed Principle`, as the `Dispatcher` do not need 
to be aware of how the different `Controller` do their tokenization, and only interact with each 
`Controller` through the common API `tokenize`. For new commands with vastly different formats, you can 
then easily add a new `Controller` with its own `tokenize` implementation.

#### 3.4.2. Responsible for its own parameter suggestions

To support parameter suggestion, each `Controller` must also implement the API `getSuggestedKeywordMapping` 
which provide a list of parameters for each command, as well as any options specific to a parameter. 
Again, there was a conscious decision to let this be provided individually by each `Controller`. Though an 
alternative approach is to have a single class that stores all the keywords used by all commands, this 
approach quickly grows out of hand when there are different commands having the same parameter, but used for 
different purposes. 

Again, `Open Closed Principle` is applied here, where a new `Controller` can be added easily while the 
implementation for getting suggested keyword inside `CommandDispatcher` can remain unchanged.

### 3.5. Model component

**API** : [`TodoList.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/toluist/model/TodoList.java)

The `Model` stores the task data for the app inside the memory.

### 3.6. Storage component

**API** : [`TodoListStorage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/toluist/storage/TodoListStorage.java)

The `Storage` component
- acts like a database in the application.
- provides read/write funcionalities to the `Model`, encapsuling all the inner implementation details.
- can save the task data in json format and read it back.
- holds the history of all data changes

#### Undoable History

`undoHistoryStack` hold the serialized json strings of the task list data. The minimum size of this stack is 
always 1. The json string at the top of the stack is the serialization of the current todo list data.

To undo the most recent changes, we simply pop the irrelevant strings in `undoHistoryStack` and then deserialize the json string at the top of the stack into task list data.

An alternative approach to implementing undoable history is to create a `unexecute` method for each mutating 
command, 
and have a local 
history 
of the data changes in each Controller instance. Compared to this alternative, storing a centralized history of data 
changes in the storage is much more robust, as we can avoid checking every Controller instance to 
get the previous data state. An additional benefit is that the integrity of the data change order is guaranteed in 
the `undoHistoryStack`, and we do not need to keep track of what the previous mutating commands were.

## 2. Quick Start

### 2.1. Install

1. Before using the app, ensure that you have at least [Java Runtime Environment Version 8 Update 60](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
installed on your computer, so that our app can run properly.
    >   Having any Java 8 version is not enough. 
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. Using your favourite browser (our recommended choice is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/))
, navigate to our [releases page](https://github.com/CS2103JAN2017-W13-B3/main/releases). Download the latest `toluist.jar` on this page. The current 
latest version should be v0.5.
  
3. Copy the file `toluist` to a folder on your computer where you would like to store your todo list data.

### 2.2. Launch

1. To launch the app, double-click on the file `toluist.jar` you downloaded in [Installing](#21-installing). 
2. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. Refer to the figure below to see how ToLuist should initially look like on your first launch.
   
   <img src="images/Ui.png" width="600"><br>
   **Figure 2.2**: Initial launch screen of ToLuist

### 2.3. Get used to the interface

With some tasks added in, the interface of ToLuist may look as follows.

   <img src="images/Ui-parts.png" width="600"/><br>
    **Figure 2.3**: Different components in ToLuist's Ui
    
At the very top of the app, the **App Title**, which include a cute app icon, will highlight that you are 
using ToLuist.
    
Occupying the main bulk of the app, the **Task List** lies in the center of ToLuist. Depending on the 
commands that were entered, as well as the tab selected, the **Task List** may display different sets of 
tasks here. Notice each task is prefixed with an index number. For example, the task `update the user 
guide` has the index number 3. ToLuist use the index number to uniquely identify a displayed tasks in 
various commands.

The **Tab Bar** lies just above the **Task List**. It indicates which tab is currently selected by the user
. Depending on the tab selected, the **Task List** will change to only show a subset of the current tasks 
(which can be all the tasks in the app, or found tasks that match some search keyword(s)) that satisfy 
the condition described in the highlighted tab. There are 5 different tabs that can be selected:
   * INCOMPLETE: Displays only the subset of current tasks that are not yet completed.
   * TODAY: Displays only the subset of current tasks that are due by / are happening on the current day.
   * NEXT 7 DAYS: Displays only the subset of current tasks that are due by / are happening during the 
    next 7 days, not including the current day.
   * COMPLETED: Displays only the subset of current tasks that are completed.
   * ALL: Displays all current tasks.
    
Note that in the label for each tab, there are some statistics describing the amount of current tasks, and 
how many of these tasks satisfy that the's condition. For example, in the figure above, `INCOMPLETE` tab's 
label is `INCOMPLETE (5/6)`, indicating that there are 5 incomplete tasks out of all 6 current tasks.

The **Command Box** is where you type in your commands. Feedback to your command is displayed in the 
**Result Display**.

Finally, the **Status Bar** is at the bottom of the app. It indicates where your app data is currently 
located.

### 2.4. Try out some commands

Type out these command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it.

1. Since you are new to the app, type in `help` to get some information on the commands ToLuist supports.
2. Try out some example commands:
   * **`add`**` Try Out Todo List` :
     adds a task named `Try Out Todo List` to the todo list.
   * **`delete`**` 1` : deletes the 1st task shown in the current list.
   * **`exit`** : exits the app.
3 Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.<br>

```

### 3.9. Complete or Make Incomplete a Task : `mark`

After you completed a task, you may want to indicate this in ToLuist. Alternatively, you may want to mark 
a completed task as incomplete if you feel that it still needs more work.
`mark` allow you to set the completion status for a task or multiple tasks.<br>
Format: `mark [complete/incomplete] INDEX(ES)`

> * Using complete as a parameter will mark the selected task(s) as complete.
> * Using incomplete as a parameter will mark the selected task(s) as incomplete.
> * Using neither will default the command to mark as complete.
> * Supports marking of multiple indexes in a single command.

Example:
* `mark complete 1` <br>
  Marks task 1 as complete.
* `mark incomplete 2` <br>
  Marks task 2 as incomplete.
* `mark 3` <br>
  Marks task 3 as complete.
* `mark 3 -`<br>
  Marks tasks from 3rd to last in the todo list as complete.
* `mark incomplete - 5`<br>
  Marks tasks from first to 5th task in the todo list as incomplete.
* `mark 5, - 3, 7-8 10, 12 -`<br>
  Marks tasks from 1st to 3rd, 5th, 7th, 8th, 10th, and from 12th to last task in the todo list as complete.

### 3.13. Undo a command : `undo`

As human, we make mistakes, perhaps by entering a wrong command. In these cases, you may wish to reverse 
the result of your command.<br>
`undo` allows you to undo your previous command(s).<br>
Format: `undo [NUMBER]`

> * `undo` allows reverting of modifications to the tasks in the todo list. This means that commands like 
`add`, `update`, `delete`, `clear`, `tag`, `untag` and `mark` which modifies the tasks can be reversed with
> `undo`. If loading a different data file with `load` causes the current tasks to be changed, you can go back
> to the previous list of tasks using `undo` too (Using `undo`, however, won't revert the change of data 
storage path. It's not considered modifications to the task).
> Changes that are not modifications to the tasks in the todo list cannot be reversed with `undo`. However, 
> you can still easily revert their effects:
>   * Changing of storage path location (with `save` / `load` ) - You can change your storage path to the 
previous location with `save`.
>   * Setting of aliases (with `alias`) - You can remove the alias with `unalias`.
>   * Removing aliases (with `unalias`) - You can set back the alias with `alias`.
>   * Re-ordering the list of tasks (with `sort`) - You can set back the previous sorting order with `sort`.
>
> * If a number is entered, undoes that amount of previous commands instead.
> * You can also use key combination <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> to quickly undo one time.

Examples:

* `add Test`<br>
  `undo`<br>
  Undo adding Test to the todo list.
* `add Assignment` <br>
  `add Project` <br>
  `undo 2`<br>
  Undo both commands.
* `add Test`<br>
  Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> <br>
  Undo adding Test to the todo list.

### 3.14. Redo a command : `redo`

After undoing a command, you want to re-apply it.<br>
`redo` allows you to redo previously undone commands.<br>
Format: `redo [NUMBER]`

> * Similar to `undo`, `redo` will help you re-apply modifications to the tasks in the todo list that 
> * you mistakenly revoked (using `undo`).<br>
> * If a number is entered, redo that amount of previous commands instead.<br>
> * The number must be less than or equal to the number of commands undone.
> * You can also use key combination <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Y</kbd> to quickly redo one time.

Examples:

* `add Test`<br>
  `undo`<br>
  `redo` <br>
  Redo adding Test to the todo list.
* `add Assignment` <br>
  `add Project`<br>
  `undo 2`<br>
  `redo`<br>
  Redo `add Assignment`.
* `add Test`<br>
  `undo`<br>
  Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Y</kbd> <br>
  Redo adding Test to the todo list.

```
