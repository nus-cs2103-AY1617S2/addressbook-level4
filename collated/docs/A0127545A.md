**Google Calendar**

Pros:

* Support recurring events.
* Monthly, weekly, daily calendar view is useful for users to visualise their schedule.
* Support fuzzy search for events.
* Certain operations does not require clicking (e.g. add event).
* Support sharing of calendar with other users through export to CSV or iCal.
* Can be used offline.

Cons:

* Does not support task without deadline.
* Does not support marking task as complete/incomplete.
* Certain operations requires clicking (e.g. update task), which is not what Jim wants.

### 3.4. Adding a task: `add`

You can start keeping track of your task by adding to ToLuist.<br>
`add` allows you to add a task to the system.<br>
Format: `add NAME [/from STARTDATE /to ENDDATE] [/by ENDDATE] [/repeat PERIOD(day/week/month)] [/priority PRIORITY(high/low)] [/tags TAGS]`

> * Both 'startdate' and 'enddate' use the same datetime format.
> * 'startdate' requires a valid 'enddate' to be used in the same command.
> * The values entered for 'startdate' and 'enddate' are very flexible:<br>
    Standard dates are parsed, with the month being before the day. i.e. `MM/DD/YY`, `MM/DD/YYYY`, `YYYY/MM/DD`, `YYYY/MM/DD`<br>
    Relaxed dates are parsed as logically as possible. i.e. `Jan 21, '97`, `Sun, Nov 21`, `The 31st of April in the year 2017`<br>
    Relative dates are also allowed. i.e. `Yesterday`, `Today`, `Next Sunday`, `3 Days from now`<br>
    Standard times are parsed in as well. i.e. `0600h`, `8pm`, `noon`, `4:30 p.m.`<br>
    Similar to dates, relative times are also allowed. i.e. `5 minutes from now`, `in 10 minutes`, `5 hours ago`<br>
    For more details, please visit http://natty.joestelmach.com/doc.jsp.
> * ToLuist will auto scroll to the newly added task.

Examples:

* `add Do Homework` <br>
  Adds a task called 'Do Homework'.
* `add Meeting With Boss /from 11-11-2011 17:30 /to 11-11-2011 19:30` <br>
  Adds a task called 'Meeting With Boss', with start date 11-11-2011 17:30, and end date to be 11-11-2011 19:30.
* `add Check Email /by today` <br>
  Adds a task called 'Check Email', and sets the deadline to be today's date.

```

### 3.5. Updating a task : `update`

Sometimes, you may need to update or fix a previously entered task.<br>
`update` allows you to update an existing task in the list.<br>
Format: `update INDEX [NAME] [/from STARTDATE /to ENDDATE] [/by ENDDATE] [/repeat PERIOD(day/week/month)] [/stoprepeat] [/priority PRIORITY(high/low)] [/tags TAGS]`

> * Updates the task at the specified `INDEX`. <br>
    The index refers to the index number shown in the last task listing.
> * Only fields entered will be updated.
> * When editing tags, the existing tags of the task will be set to contain the new tags; the old tags will be removed.


Examples:

* `update 2 Assignment 3`<br>
  Updates the name of the 2nd task to be `Assignment 3`.
* `update 3 /from today /to tomorrow` <br>
  Updates the start date and end date of the 3rd task to today and tomorrow respectively.

### 3.8. Deleting a task : `delete`

Assuming you have been using ToLuist for a long while, you may want to remove some of your older tasks.<br>
`delete` allows you to delete a task or multiple tasks from the todo list.<br>
Format: `delete INDEX(ES)`

> * Deletes the task at the specified `INDEX`. <br>
> * The index(es) refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
> * Supports deletion of multiple indexes in a single command.

Examples:

* `delete 2`<br>
  Deletes the 2nd task in the todo list.
* `delete 3 - 6`<br>
  Deletes the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th task in the todo list.<br>
* `delete 3 -`<br>
  Deletes from 3rd to last in the todo list.
* `delete - 5`<br>
  Deletes from first to 5th task in the todo list.
* `delete 5, - 3, 7-8 10, 12 -`<br>
  Deletes from 1st to 3rd, 5th, 7th, 8th, 10th, and from 12th to last task in the todo list.
