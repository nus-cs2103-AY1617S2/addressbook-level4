### 3.3. Adding a task: `add`

For when you have a task you need to remember.<br>
Adds a task to the todo list<br>
Format: `add NAME [startdate/STARTDATE] [enddate/ENDDATE] [recurring/PERIOD(day/week/month)] [priority/PRIORITY] [tag/TAG]...`

> * Both 'startdate' and 'enddate' use the same datetime format.
> * 'startdate' requires a valid 'enddate' to be used in the same command.
> * The values entered for 'startdate' and 'enddate' are very flexible:<br>
    Standard dates are parsed, with the month being before the day. i.e. `MM/DD/YY`, `MM/DD/YYYY`, `YYYY/MM/DD`, `YYYY/MM/DD`<br>
    Relaxed dates are parsed as logically as possible. i.e. `Jan 21, '97`, `Sun, Nov 21`, `The 31st of April in the year 2017`<br>
    Relative dates are also allowed. i.e. `Yesterday`, `Today`, `Next Sunday`, `3 Days from now`<br>
    Standard times are parsed in as well. i.e. `0600h`, `8pm`, `noon`, `4:30 p.m.`<br>
    Similar to dates, relative times are also allowed. i.e. `5 minutes from now`, `in 10 minutes`, `5 hours ago`<br>
    For more details, please visit http://natty.joestelmach.com/doc.jsp.

Examples:

* `add Do Homework` <br>
  Adds a task called 'Do Homework'.
* `add Meeting With Boss startdate/11-11-2011 17:30 enddate/11-11-2011 19:30` <br>
  Adds a task called 'Meeting With Boss', with start date 11-11-2011 17:30, and end date to be 11-11-2011 19:30.
* `add Check Email enddate/today` <br>
  Adds a task called 'Check Email', and sets the deadline to be today's date.

```

### 3.5. Updating a task : `update`

For when you need to update or fix a previously entered task.<br>
Updates an existing task in the todo list.<br>
Format: `update INDEX [NAME] [startdate/STARTDATE] [enddate/ENDDATE] [recurring/PERIOD(day/week/month)] [priority/PRIORITY] [tag/TAG]...`

> * Updates the task at the specified `INDEX`. <br>
    The index refers to the index number shown in the last task listing.
> * Only fields entered will be updated.
> * When editing tags, the existing tags of the task will be set to contain the new tags; the old tags will be removed.


Examples:

* `update 2 Assignment 3`<br>
  Updates the name of the 2nd task to be `Assignment 3`.
* `update 3 startdate/today enddate/tomorrow` <br>
  Updates the start date and end date of the 3rd task to today and tomorrow respectively.

```

### 3.7. Deleting a task : `delete`

For when your task is no longer necessary.<br>
Deletes the specified task from the todo list.<br>
Format: `delete INDEX(ES)`

> * Deletes the task at the specified `INDEX`. <br>
> * The index(es) refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
> * Supports deletion of multiple indexes in a single command.

Examples:

* `delete 2`<br>
  Deletes the 2nd task in the todo list.
* `delete 3 - 6`<br>
  Deletes the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th task in the todo list.<br>
* `delete 3 -`<br>
  Deletes from 3rd to last in the todo list.
* `delete - 5`<br>
  Deletes from first to 5th task in the todo list.
* `delete 5, - 3, 7-8 10, 12 -`<br>
  Deletes from 1st to 3rd, 5th, 7th, 8th, 10th, and from 12th to last task in the todo list.
