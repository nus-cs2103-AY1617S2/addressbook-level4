**Apple's Notes App**

Author: Wang Yu

**Pros:**

* Apple's built-in Notes App is nothing different from a paper notebook except that it is electronic which makes it capable of storing more than enough notes and deleting notes that are no longer needed
* Due to its sustainability, Notes is very suitable for traditional notes takers who are not comfortable with being restricted by commands and forms
* With the Notes App on iCloud.com, users can easily get to see their notes on different platforms if Internet connection is available

**Cons:**

* Notes is only available for the Apple OS platform. As our target are MS users, Notes is not an option for them
* Notes cannot recognize task's data and group them together
* All the updating need to be done by directly manipulating the text, which is quite a bother
* If the user mistakenly edited something wrongly, there is no turning back for them since there is no undo function

### 2.6. Showing done/undone tasks: `show`

Shows tasks that are done or undone.<br>
Format: `show done/undone`

> * This command is case insensitive. e.g `DONE` works the same as `done`
> * Only the status is searched.
> * Only full words will be matched e.g `do` will not match `done`

Examples:

* `show done`<br>
  Returns tasks that are done
* `show undone`<br>
  Returns tasks that are undone
```
