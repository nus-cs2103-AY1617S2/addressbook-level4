* This is a desktop Task Manager application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using
  a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code example that is
  **significantly bigger** (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
* It leverages on a Java sample application [[AddressBook level 4](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4)] intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as the main programming language.
* Support for *Build Automation* using Gradle and for *Continuous Integration* using Travis CI.
