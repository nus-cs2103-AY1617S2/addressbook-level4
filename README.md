* This is a desktop Address Book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using
  a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as
  the main programming language.
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code example that is
  **significantly bigger** (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
* What's different from [level 3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3):
    * A more sophisticated GUI that includes a list panel and an in-built Browser.
    * More test cases, including automated GUI testing.
    * Support for *Build Automation* using Gradle and for *Continuous Integration* using Travis CI.
