* Suru is a task manager application. It has a GUI to display user tasks and checklist but most of the user interactions
  happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as
  the main programming language.
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code example that is
  **significantly bigger** (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.

* Support for *Build Automation* using Gradle and for *Continuous Integration* using Travis CI.
