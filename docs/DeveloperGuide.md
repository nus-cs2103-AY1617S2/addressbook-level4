## 1. Introduction
<p>Doist is a task manager that can simplify your life with the press of a button! Designed for users who like to use the keyboard, Doist can accept natural language commands to help you keep track of all your daily tasks.</p>
<p>This developer guide aims to give developers a nuts and bolts insight into Doist, to encourage and facilitate contribution to the development of this application.</p>


<br>


## 2. Setting up

### 2.1. Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Follow the instructions given at
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace
5. **Checkstyle Plug-in** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


### 2.2. Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given
   in the prerequisites above)
3. Click `File` > `Import`
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
6. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

### 2.3. Configuring Checkstyle
1. Click `Project` -> `Properties` -> `Checkstyle` -> `Local Check Configurations` -> `New...`
2. Choose `External Configuration File` under `Type`
3. Enter an arbitrary configuration name e.g. addressbook
4. Import checkstyle configuration file found at `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`
5. Click OK once, go to the `Main` tab, use the newly imported check configuration.
6. Tick and select `files from packages`, click `Change...`, and select the `resources` package
7. Click OK twice. Rebuild project if prompted

> Note to click on the `files from packages` text after ticking in order to enable the `Change...` button  

### 2.4. Troubleshooting project setup

* **Problem**: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git
    - *Reason*: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull.
    - *Solution*: Refresh the project in Eclipse:
  Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose `Gradle` -> `Refresh Gradle Project`.

* **Problem**: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing
    - *Reason*: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import.
    - *Solution*: [Run tests using Gradle](UsingGradle.md) once (to refresh the libraries).

<br>


## 3. Design

### 3.1. Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of Doist. Each of the components illustrated pertain to a specfic aspect of the App, and are briefly discussed below.

#### `Main`
The `Main` component is the heart of the App. It is responsible for
- initializing other components (`Model`, `Logic`, `UI`) in the correct order and loading data from local storage when the app launches.  
- terminating other components when Doist is shut down.

#### [`UI`](#2-ui-component)
The `UI` component serves as the eyes and ears of the App. It handles all user interactions, as well as displaying information to the user.

#### [`Logic`](#3-logic-component)
The `Logic` component is the brains behind the App. It takes charge of parsing the user input and executing the commands.

#### [`Model`](#4-model-component)
The `Model` component is the spine around which the App has been built. It represents the data that Doist operates on and also supports the operations on the same.

#### [`Storage`](#5-storage-component)
The `Storage` component handles the App's memory. It takes charge of reading data from, and writing data to, the hard disk.

#### `Commons`
The `Commons` component is akin to the nervous system of the App. It contains a collection of classes used by multiple other components. The following are 2 representatives.
- EventsCenter : supports the communication among different components using events
- LogsCenter : enables writing log messages to the log file.

#### Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`.

<img src="images\SDforDeletePerson.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TodoListChangedEvent` when the TodoList data are changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>
<img src="images\SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2. UI component
The `UI` is the main form of interaction between Doist and the user. `UI` executes commands entered by the user and updates itself to reflect the results of these commands. It works closely with `Logic` component to execute commands, and also responds to events raised internally by Doist.

The following diagram represents the structure of the `UI` component  
<br><img src="images/UIComponentClassDiagram.PNG" width="800"><br>

Here are some of the key files in the `Ui` component:
- [`UI.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/doist/ui/Ui.java):  contains an `interface` that defines two operations that control the UI of the App.
    These operations are defined using different methods (API).  
    Some representative methods are listed here:  
    ```java  
    void start(Stage primaryStage)
    void stop()  
    ```  
- `UiManager.java`: contains a `class` that implements the operations specified in `Ui.java`.
- `MainWindow.java`: contains a `class` that represents the Main Window viewed by the user.
- `CommandBox.java`: contains a `class` that represents the Command Box used by the user to enter commands.

### 3.3. Logic component
The `Logic` component handles the execution of the commands entered by the user. It consists of several subcomponents, most notably the `Parser` and `Command` class. `Logic` also prepares the information to be used by the `UI` to display to the user.

The following diagram represents the structure of the `Logic` component  
<br><img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

Here are some of the key files in the `Logic` component:
- [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/doist/logic/Logic.java):  contains an `interface` that defines operations to obtain the results of computations.  
    These operations are defined using different methods (API).  
    Some representative methods are listed here:  
    ```java  
    CommandResult execute(String commandText) throws CommandException;
    ObservableList<ReadOnlyTask> getFilteredPersonList();  
    ```  
- `LogicManager.java`: contains a `class` that implements the operations specified in `Model.java`.
- `Parser.java`: contains a `class` that is in charge of parsing commands.
- `Command.java`: contains a `class` that represents each command defined in Doist.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>
<img src="images/DeletePersonSdForLogic.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

### 3.4. Model component
The `Model` component defines classes that represent the data Doist operates on. It also specifies and implements operations that work on the data.  

The following diagram represents the structure of the `Model` component  
<br><img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>  

Here are some of the key files in the `Model` component:
- [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/doist/model/Model.java):  contains an `interface` that defines multiple operations on the data.  
    These operations are defined using different methods (API).  
    Some representative methods are listed here:  
    ```java  
    void finishTask(ReadOnlyTask target) throws UniqueTaskList.TaskNotFoundException, UniqueTaskList.TaskAlreadyFinishedException;
    void addTask(Task task) throws UniqueTaskList.DuplicateTaskException;
    void deleteTask(ReadOnlyTask target) throws UniqueTaskList.TaskNotFoundException;  
    ```  
- `ModelManager.java`: contains a `class` that implements the operations specified in `Model.java`.
- `TodoList.java`: contains a `class` that represents the to-do list.
- `Task.java`: contains a `class` that represents each to-do list item (i.e. task).
- `UserPrefs.java`: contains a class that stores user preferences such as the position and size of the app window.

### 3.5. Storage component
The `Storage` component takes charge of reading and writing (R/W) data, to and from the hard drive.
This data consists of **user preferences** and **to-do list** :
- **user preferences** is stored in a **JSON** file.
- **to-do list** is stored in a **XML** file.

The following diagram represents the structure of the `Storage` component  
<br><img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>  

Here are some of the key files in the `Storage` component:
- [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/doist/storage/StorageManager.java):  contains an `interface` that defines R/W operations on **user preferences** and **to-do list**.  
    These operations are defined using different methods (API).  
    Some representative methods are listed here:  
    ```java  
    Optional<UserPrefs> readUserPrefs() throws DataConversionException, IOException;
    void saveUserPrefs(UserPrefs userPrefs) throws IOException;
    Optional<ReadOnlyTodoList> readTodoList() throws DataConversionException, IOException;
    void saveTodoList(ReadOnlyTodoList todoList) throws IOException;  
    ```  
- `StorageManager.java`: contains a `class` that implements the operations specified in `Storage.java`.
- `XmlTodoListStorage`: contains a `class` that implements the R/W operations on **to-do list**. An instance of this class is utilized in `StorageManager`.
- `JsonUserPrefsStorage`: contains a `class` that implements the R/W operations on **user preferences**. An instance of this class is used in `StorageManager`.

<br>


## 4. Implementation

### 4.1. Undo and Redo
Whenever a mutating command, such as `add`, `delete` and `edit`, is executed, the new state of the to-do list will be stored into history.
> Note: Although `undo` and `redo` should also be considered as mutating commands, they will not trigger the new state of the to-do list to be stored into history.

`undo` and `redo` are implemented by navigating through the to-do list history as mentioned above.  
To be more specific, the to-do list history is represented by 2 stacks of `TodoList` objects, as implemented in this file: [`History.java`](#../src/main/java/seedu/doist/commons/util/History.java).

> Remark: There are 2 common ways to implement undo and redo feature: `saving states (what we are doing)` and `generating state (saving commands)`. There are 2 reasons why we chose the first implementation:
> 1. If we save the commands instead, we have to implement a reverse / undo method for each command, which will be time-consuming due to the complexity of the commands.
> 2. When we copy the `TodoList` object, the constituent `Task` objects will not be copied. Thus, only new references will be created and this is less memory-intensive compared to creating a deep copy of all the `Task` objects.

### 4.2. Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

#### Logging Levels

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### 4.3. Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file
(default: `config.json`):

<br>


## 5. Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

### 5.1. Types of tests

#### 5.1.1. GUI Tests
These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI.
   These are in the `guitests` package.
> ##### *Headless GUI Testing*
> Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode.
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.

#### 5.1.2. Non-GUI Tests
These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`

### 5.2. How to test
#### 5.2.1. In Eclipse

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run As` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose to run as a JUnit test.

#### 5.2.2. Using Gradle

* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.


### 5.3. Troubleshooting tests
 - **Problem**: Tests fail because NullPointException when AssertionError is expected  
    - *Reason*: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests.
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later)  
    - *Solution*: Enable assertions in JUnit tests as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).  
    Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.

<br>


## 6. Dev Ops

### 6.1. Build Automation

You can learn how to use Gradle for build automation from [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md).

### 6.2. Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
You can read [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) and [UsingAppVeyor.md](UsingAppVeyor.md) for more details.

### 6.3. Publishing Documentation

You can learn how to use GitHub Pages to publish documentation to the project site from [UsingGithubPages.md](UsingGithubPages.md).

### 6.4. Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) and upload the JAR file you created.

### 6.5. Managing Dependencies

Doist depends on third-party libraries, such as [Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing, [Natty](http://natty.joestelmach.com) for date and time parsing.  
Managing these _dependencies_ has been automated using Gradle. Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives.Therefore, there is no need to include those libraries in the repo, which will bloat the repo size, or download those libraries manually, which reates extra work for developers. To add new 3-party libraries, update `build.gradle`.

- About the properties
    - `Priority`
    There are three priorities: High, Medium, Low. By default, tasks are low priority.
    - `Tags`
    Tags are independent of tasks. Tags and tasks have a many-to-many relationship where zero or more tags can be added to a task and zero or more tasks can be listed under a tag
    - `Recurrence interval`
    Specifies the interval at which user wants to be reminded of a recurring task
- Special Types
    - `Event`
    A task with different `start time` and `end time`. It represents tasks to be carried out over a period of time
    - `Deadline`
    A task with the same `start time` and `end time`. It represents tasks that have to be done before a specific time
    - `Floating task`
    A task with neither `start time` nor `end time`. It represents tasks that are not associated with any timing. It can only be `pending` and `finished`, never `overdue`
    - `Pending tasks`
    Tasks that have not been `finished` nor `ended`
    - `Overdue tasks`
    Tasks that have `ended` but not been `finished`
    - `Finished tasks`
    Tasks that have been `finished`
    - `Recurring task`
    A task with a `recurrence interval` set. A new task will automatically be cloned from this task, with the recurrence interval added to the task's `start time`, `end time` and `reminder time` when a task is marked as `Finished` or becomes `Overdue`
