## 1. Introduction
DoIt is a task manager to help users to organise their busy schedules using keyboard commands. It is a written in Java and uses JavaFX for its GUI<br>

This guide aims to help developers understand how DoIt works by describing its design and implementation. The guide is organised in a top-down fashion to give readers an overview of the entire program before diving into more detailed sections

## 2. Setting up

### 2.1 Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>
    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough
    *Doit* will not work with earlier versions of Java 8

2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace
5. **Checkstyle Plug-in** from the Eclipse Marketplace


### 2.2 Importing the Project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given
   in the prerequisites above)
3. Click `File` > `Import`
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
6. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish.
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes

### 2.3 Configuring Checkstyle
1. Click `Project` -> `Properties` -> `Checkstyle` -> `Local Check Configurations` -> `New...`
2. Choose `External Configuration File` under `Type`
3. Enter an arbitrary configuration name (e.g. taskManager)
4. Import checkstyle configuration file found at `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`
5. Click OK once, go to the `Main` tab, use the newly imported check configuration
6. Tick and select `files from packages`, click `Change...`, and select the `resources` package
7. Click OK twice
8. Rebuild project if prompted

> Note to click on the `files from packages` text after ticking in order to enable the `Change...` button

### 2.4 Troubleshooting Project Setup

**Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**

* Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull
* Solution: Refresh the project in Eclipse by right clicking on the project (in Eclipse package explorer) and choosing `Gradle` -> `Refresh Gradle Project`

**Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries are missing**

* Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import
* Solution: [Run tests using Gradle](UsingGradle.md) once (to refresh the libraries)


## 3. Design

### 3.1 Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The **Figure 2.1.1** above explains the high-level design of DoIt

Below is a quick overview of each component:

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other  at app launch
* Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup method where necessary  at shut down

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of [Event-driven architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture))
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to *DoIt*'s log file

The rest of DoIt consists of four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of *DoIt*
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holding the data of DoIt in-memory
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reading data from, and writing data to, the hard disk

Each of the four components

* Defines its API in an `interface` with the same name as the component
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class

For example, `Logic` (seen in **Figure 2.1.2**) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class<br>
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

### 3.2 Events-Driven Nature of the Design

The **Figure 2.1.3a** below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`

<img src="images\SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskManagerChangedEvent` when the DoIt data are changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk

The **Figure 2.1.3b** shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time<br>
<img src="images\SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component Interactions for `delete 1` Command (part 2)_

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct
  coupling between components

The sections below give more details of each component

### 3.3 UI Component

Author: Ye Huan Hui

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.2.1 : Class Diagram of the UI Component_

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/doit/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change
* Responds to events raised from various parts of DoIt and updates the UI accordingly


The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts (e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,`TaskListPanel`, `EventListPanel`,`FloatingTaskListPanel`,`StatusBarFooter` etc). All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files found in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/doit/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)<br>

The `CommandBox` component handles the field for user input

The `UiManager` component implements `Ui` interface.The `UiManager` is the manager of the UI component, and it contains event handling methods

The `UiPart` component is an abstract class, represents a distinct part of the UI. It contains a scene graph with a root node.

The `TaskListPanel` component,`EventlistPanel`component and `FloatingTaskListPanel` component display `TaskCard` objects in listviews

The `TaskCard` component associates with each task in the observablelist, containing all attributes of the task, with images loaded on attributes like priority, existence  of description


### 3.4 Logic Component

Author: Lee Jin Shun

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.3.1 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

The `Logic` component:

* Parses the user command using the `Parser` class
* Creates a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`
* Invokes changes to the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raises events
* Encapsulates a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`

The Logic consists of a `Parser` class which parses the user command coming from the `UI` Component.

The `Parser` class then calls the corresponding parser for the specific ommand, for e.g. `DeleteCommandParser`.

The command parser, for this case `DeleteCommandParser` will now create an instance of `DeleteCommand`.

This `Command` object is then executed by the `LogicManager` which can invoke changes in the `Model` class.

This can be done through various actions such as adding or editing a task.

Finally, the result of the command execution is encapsulated in a `CommandResult` object and passed back to the `UI`.

The `Command` pattern is evident in this component, as you can see a request encapsulated as a object allowing you to parametrize clients with different requests.


Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call<br>
<img src="images/DeleteTaskSdForLogic.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

### 3.5 Model Component

Author: Hon Kean Wai

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.4.1 : Class Diagram of the Model Component_

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component:

* Stores the user's preferences
* Stores and manages DoIt's task list data
* Exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed'
(e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change)
* Remains unaffected by changes in the other three components due to application of the Observer Pattern
* Interacts with the other components by raising events

The `Model` class is the interface of the `Model` component. It provides several APIs for the other components to retrieve and update DoIt's task list data. The organization and relationship of the various classes are represented in Figure 2.4.1

The `ModelManager` implements the `Model` interface. It contains a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user's preferences. It also contains a `TaskManager` along with a `TaskManagerStack` which represents a stack of `TaskManager` objects which are necessary from redo and undo commands. `TaskManagerStack` is implemented as a Singleton Pattern as there should exist only one instance of it the app is running.

Each `TaskManager` contains a single `UniqueTaskList` object. It also provides methods that directly manipulate the data in the `UniqueTaskList`

A `UniqueTaskList` is a list of `task` objects and cannot contain duplicate `tasks`

The `ReadOnlyTaskManager` and `ReadOnlyTask` interfaces allow other classes and components, such as the UI, to access but not modify the list of tasks and their details

The `TaskManagerStack` represents a stack of TaskManager objects. This stack is called by the `ModelManager` whenever it receives a undo or redo command.`TaskManagerStack` is implemented as a Singleton Pattern and there should exist only one instance of it every time you start DoIt

The `InputStack` represents a stack valid or invalid non-empty input command the user entered into the command box of UI component. This stack is called by the `CommandBox` class in UI component to output the needed input string onto the command box.`InputStack` is also implemented as a Singleton Pattern as there should exist only one instance of it every time you start DoIt

### 3.6 Storage Component

Author: Chew Chia Sin

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/doit/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component:

* Saves `UserPrefs` objects in json format and load it back
* Saves the DoIt data in xml format and load it back

The `Storage` class is the interface of the `Storage` component. It provides several APIs for the other components to retrieve and update DoIt's task list data. The organization and relationship of the various classes are represented in Figure 2.5.1

The `StorageManager` implements the `Storage` interface. It contains a `UserPrefsStorage` interface that references `JsonUserPrefsStorage` allows storing and loading of the user's preferences in json format. It also contains a `TaskManagerStorage` interface that references `XmlTaskManagerStorage` that allows storing and loading of the user's DoIt data

The `XmlSerializableTaskManager` is a class that converts `ReadOnlyTaskManager` into a serializable object with which contains a list of `XmlAdaptedTask` and a list of `XmlAdaptedTag`

`XmlAdaptedTask` converts the Model's `Task` into a JAXB-friendly adapted version
`XmlAdaptedTag` converts the Model's `Tag` into a JAXB-friendly adapted version

### 3.7 Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.doit.commons` package

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of DoIt
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by DoIt
* `FINE` : Details that are not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  (e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size)

### 4.2 Configuration

Certain properties of DoIt can be controlled (e.g. App name, logging level) through the configuration file
(default: `config.json`):


## 5. Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder

**In Eclipse**:

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose to run as a JUnit test

**Using Gradle**:

* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle

### 5.1 Headless GUI Testing
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the headless mode
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI
   These are in the `guitests` package

2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes<br>
      (e.g. `seedu.doit.commons.UrlUtilTest`)
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units
     (those code units are assumed to be working)<br>
     (e.g. `seedu.doit.storage.StorageManagerTest`)
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as
      how the are connected together.<br>
      (e.g. `seedu.doit.logic.LogicManagerTest`)


### 5.2 Troubleshooting Failed Tests

 **Tests fail due to NullPointException when AssertionError is expected**

 * Reason: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests.
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version. (i.e. _Neon_ or later)
 * Solution: Enable assertions in JUnit tests as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option) and delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.

## 6. Dev Ops

### 6.1 Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation

### 6.2 Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) and [UsingAppVeyor.md](UsingAppVeyor.md) for more details

### 6.3 Publishing Documentation

See [UsingGithubPages.md](UsingGithubPages.md) to learn how to use GitHub Pages to publish documentation to the project site

### 6.4 Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release:

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file)
 2. Tag the repo with the version number (e.g.`v0.1`)
 2. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) and upload the JAR file you created

### 6.5 Converting Documentation to PDF Format

We use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format:

 1. Make sure you have set up GitHub Pages as described in [UsingGithubPages.md](UsingGithubPages.md#setting-up)
 2. Using Chrome, go to the [GitHub Pages version (UsingGithubPages.md#viewing-the-project-site) of the documentation file
 3. Click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu
 4. Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format<br>
    For the best results, use the settings indicated in Figure 5.4.1<br>
    <img src="images/chrome_save_as_pdf.png" width="300"><br>
    _Figure 5.4.1 : Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome_

### 6.6 Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, DoIt depends on the [Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these dependencies can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives: <br>
* Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
* Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

## 7. Appendix A : User Stories
