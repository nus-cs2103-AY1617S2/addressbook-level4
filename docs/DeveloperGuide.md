# Developer Guide

This guide is for developers who wish to continue developing GeeKeep.

GeeKeep is a simple Command-Line-Interface (CLI) based Task Manager app. It is a Task Manager for users who prefer typing over reliance on GUI. In this guide, you can find information which is helpful in getting started as a GeeKeep contributor with respect to the code, tests, and design of the architecture.

In order to better contribute, you should:
* Be proficient in object-oriented programming with Java.
* Be familiar with [libraries](../README.md#dependencies), e.g. JavaFX, used by GeeKeep.
* Be familiar with [testing frameworks](../README.md#dependencies), e.g. JUnit, used by GeeKeep.
* Follow the [Java coding standard](https://oss-generic.github.io/process/codingStandards/CodingStandard-Java.html).

<h2 id="user-content-1">1. Setting up</h2>

<h3 id="user-content-pre">Prerequisites</h3>

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Follow the instructions given in [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious) from Step 2 onwards.)
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace
5. **Checkstyle Plug-in** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace or its [official website](http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/#!/install)


<h3 id="user-content-import">Importing The Project into Eclipse</h3>

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given
   in the prerequisites above).
3. Click `File` > `Import`.
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`.
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory.
6. Click `Finish`.

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process).
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

<h3 id="user-content-checkstyle">Configuring Checkstyle</h3>

1. Click `Project` -> `Properties` -> `Checkstyle` -> `Local Check Configurations` -> `New...`.
2. Choose `External Configuration File` under `Type`.
3. Enter an arbitrary configuration name e.g. GeeKeep.
4. Import checkstyle configuration file found at `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`.
5. Click OK once, go to the `Main` tab, use the newly imported check configuration.
6. Tick and select `files from packages`, click `Change...`, and select the `resources` package.
7. Click OK twice. Rebuild project if prompted.

> Note to click on the `files from packages` text after ticking in order to enable the `Change...` button.

<h3 id="user-content-trouble">Troubleshooting Project Setup</h3>

**Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**
* Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull.
* Solution: Refresh the project in Eclipse:<br>
  Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose `Gradle` -> `Refresh Gradle Project`.

**Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**
* Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import.
* Solution: [Run tests using Gradle](UsingGradle.md) once (to refresh the libraries).

<h2 id="user-content-2">2. Design</h2>

<h3 id="user-content-architecture">Architecture</h3>

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
_Figure 2.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/geekeep/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* App Launching: initialize the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* Shutting Down: shut down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the app consists four components:
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : Renders the UI.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : Parses and executes commands.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the app in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components:
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

**Events-Driven nature of the design**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`.

<img src="images\SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `GeeKeepChangedEvent` when the Task Manager data are changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>
<img src="images\SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

<h3 id="user-content-ui">UI Component</h3>

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.4 : Class Diagram of the UI Component_

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/geekeep/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/geekeep/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component:
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the app and updates the UI accordingly.

<h3 id="user-content-logic">Logic Component</h3>

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.5 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/geekeep/logic/Logic.java)

The `Logic` component: 

* Parses the user command using each command's respective `Parser`.
* Executes a `Command` object based on the command and user input.
* Encapsulates the result, a feedback `string` in a `CommandResult` object.

For example, the following is what happens when the API `execute("delete 1")` is called:

1. `LogicManager` parses the user command using the  `Parser` class.
1. `Parser` subsequently uses `DeleteCommandParser` to parse the argument `1`.
1. This results in a `DeleteCommand` object which is returned to `LogicManager`.
1. `LogicManager` executes the `DeleteCommand` object.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>
<img src="images/DeleteTaskSdForLogic.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.6 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

<h3 id="user-content-model">Model Component</h3>

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.7 : Class Diagram of the Model Component_

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/geekeep/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component:
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores the Task Manager data.
* Exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

<h3 id="user-content-storage">Storage Component</h3>

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 2.8 : Class Diagram of the Storage Component_

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/geekeep/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component:
* Can save `UserPref` objects in JSON format and read it back.
* Can save the Task Manager data in XML format and read it back.

<h3 id="user-content-commons">Common Classes</h3>

You can find classes used by multiple components in the `seedu.geekeep.commons` package. Here are some examples of common classes:
* `IllegalValueException` class used by both `Logic` and `Model` components is responsible for throwing an exception when the value is considered invalid.
* `UnmodifiableObservableList` class used by `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage` components is responsible for providing an unmodifiable view of an observable list.
* `LogsCenter` class used by all components is responsible for creating named loggers which you can further use to log messages and debug your code.

**[â¬† back to top](#user-content-table)**

<h2 id="user-content-3">3. Implementation</h2>

<h3 id="user-content-logging">Logging</h3>

You can find implementation of logging in `java.util.logging` package. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* You can control the logging level using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#user-content-config)).
* To create a `Logger` for a class and log messages according to
  the specified logging level, you can use `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)`.
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels:**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution.
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App.
* `FINE` : Details that are not noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size.

<h3 id="user-content-config">Configuration</h3>

You can control certain properties of the application (e.g app name, logging level) through the configuration file. By default, `config.json` will be created, when the configuration file is missing. To modify the configuration, you can either directly change the default `config.json` file or create another json file and pass it to the app as an application parameter before running.

A typical configuration file should have the following format:
```json
{
  "appTitle" : "GeeKeep - Command Line Featured Task Manager",
  "logLevel" : "INFO",
  "userPrefsFilePath" : "preferences.json",
  "geeKeepFilePath" : "data/geekeep.xml",
  "geeKeepName" : "MyGeeKeep"
}
```
Note: If you are going to create your own configuration file, remember to stick to the format given above.

**[â¬† back to top](#user-content-table)**

<h2 id="user-content-4">4. Testing</h2>

GeeKeep uses JUnit as the main testing framework and you can find all the tests in the `./src/test/java` folder.

<h3 id="user-content-rt">Running Tests</h3>

**In Eclipse**:
* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`.
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

There are two types of tests in this project:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire app by simulating user actions on the GUI.
   These are in the `guitests` package.

2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.geekeep.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.geekeep.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.geekeep.logic.LogicManagerTest`

**Headless GUI Testing**

Fortunately, because this project uses the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library, you can
 run GUI tests in _headless_ mode where the GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 This means you can do other things on the computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.

<h3 id="user-content-tt">Troubleshooting Tests</h3>

 **Problem: Tests fail because NullPointException when AssertionError is expected**
 * Reason: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests.
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later)
 * Solution: Enable assertions in JUnit tests as described
   [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option). <br>
   Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.

<h3 id="user-content-wt">Writing Tests</h3>

In this project, [Coveralls](https://coveralls.zendesk.com) is used to track how many statements are executed by test cases over time. You can check the current coverage report [here](https://coveralls.io/github/CS2103JAN2017-W15-B4/main?branch=master).

A sample coverage report looks like _Figure 4.1_ given below:

<img src="images/coverage.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 4.1 Sample Coverage Report_

If you click any of the source files in the report, for example, `InvalidDataTimeException` in _Figure 4.2_, you can find uncovered lines colored with red:

<img src="images/coverage_in_file.png" width="800"><br>
_Figure 4.2 Coverage Report for InvalidDataTimeException_

Referring to the coverage report, you are welcome to pick source files with low coverage and write more test cases to improve the percentage of code coverage.

<h2 id="user-content-5">5. Dev Ops</h2>

<h3 id="user-content-ba">Build Automation</h3>

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

<h3 id="user-content-ci">Continuous Integration</h3>

This project uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) to perform _Continuous Integration_.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) and [UsingAppVeyor.md](UsingAppVeyor.md) for more details.

<h3 id="user-content-mr"> Making a Release</h3>

Here are the steps to create a new release:

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)
    and upload the JAR file your created.

<h3 id="user-content-pdf"> Converting Documentation to PDF</h3>

You are recommended to use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) for converting documentation to PDF format,
as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format:

 1. Make sure you have set up GitHub Pages as described in [UsingGithubPages.md](UsingGithubPages.md#setting-up).
 1. Using Chrome, go to the [GitHub Pages version](UsingGithubPages.md#viewing-the-project-site) of the
    documentation file. <br>
    e.g. For [UserGuide.md](UserGuide.md), the URL will be `https://<your-username-or-organization-name>.github.io/geekeep/docs/UserGuide.html`.
 1. Click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
 1. Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. <br>
    For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below. <br>
    <img src="images/chrome_save_as_pdf.png" width="300"><br>
    _Figure 5.1 : Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome_

<h3 id="user-content-md"> Managing Dependencies</h3>

A project often depends on third-party libraries or testing frameworks. For example, GeeKeep depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for JSON parsing. A full list of GeeKeep's dependencies can be found in [README.md](../README.md#dependencies).

Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives:<br>
* Include those libraries in the project's repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
* Require you to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for you)<br>
