## Apple's Notes App
Apple's built-in Notes App is nothing different from a paper notebook except that it is electronic which makes it capable of storing more than enough notes and deleting notes that are no longer needed. Due to its sustainability, Notes is very suitable for traditional notes takers who are not comfortable with being restricted by commands and forms. With the Notes App on iCloud.com, users can easily get to see their notes on different platforms if Internet connection is available.

While Notes may be better than paper notebooks, there are still some problems if you want to use it as a task manager. First, Notes is only available for the Apple OS platform. As our target are MS users, Notes is not an option for them. Moreover, Notes cannot recognize task's data and group them together. All the updating need to be done by directly manipulating the text, which is quite a bother. If the user mistakenly edited something wrongly, there is no turning back for them since there is no undo function. Our App need to be more organized about the tasks than Notes.

## Calendar in iPhone
No localisation, for instance in China there is not lunar calendar and no Japanese traditional holidays calendar in Japan.

Display interface too small, unable to see all events.

Add/Remove function not user-friendly enough, hard to find.
