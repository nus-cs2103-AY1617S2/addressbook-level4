## 1. Introduction

TypeTask is an easy-to-use task manager which lets you schedule and manage your tasks simply <br>
with a single line of command! With the efficacy of a calendar without its shortcomings, <br>
TypeTask lets you organise your to-dos with ease so you can focus on your actual tasks. <br>
TypeTask is especially good if you want to: <br>

> Do everything through a single line of command <br>
> Work offline <br>
> Write tasks that have deadlines or start-dates <br>

## 2. Quick Start

### 2.1. Download
1. Ensure that you have Java version [1.8.0_60](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html) or later installed in your Computer.<br>

   ```
   > Note that simply having Java 8 is not enough.
     TypeTask will not work with the earlier versions of Java 8.
   ```

2. Download the latest version of TypeTask (click on `TypeTask.jar` under the [releases](../../../releases) tab).

<img src="images/releasesExample0.5.png" width="600">
<h5 align="left">Fig 1. Locating typetask.jar in the Releases Tab</h5>

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Task Manager.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The application should appear on your screen in a few seconds.

### 2.2. Visual Introduction
<img src="images/TypeTaskUiDescription.png" width="1000">
<h5 align="left">Fig 2. TypeTask’s User Interface </h5>

1. **Command Box**<br>
Provides a box where user commands are entered.

2. **Result Display**<br>
Displays a message detailing the results of the most recent command and the changes that occured as a result. 
The Result Display also shows a feedback message to the user if a wrong command or parameter was entered, along with an explanation of the error if relevant.

3. **Task List Panel**<br>
Displays a list of tasks under a particular list, if specified. Otherwise, it displays all tasks. TypeTask automatically assigns your tasks with certain colours to help you differentiate them easily. <br>
   
   `Red`: this uncompleted task’s deadline has passed! Better get on to it. <br>
   `Green`: this uncompleted task has a deadline but is not due yet. Phew! <br>
   `Exclamation Mark`: this uncompleted task was labelled as a priority. <br>
   `Black`: this task has been marked as completed. Check [[Fig 4]](https://github.com/CS2103JAN2017-T09-B2/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md#384-listing-completed-tasks--listdone) to view the format. <br>
   ```
   > All tasks that fall outside of these categories will appear normally.
      i.e. no additional colours.
   ```
   Type any command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. <br>
   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window.

   Other example commands you can try:
   * **`list`** : lists all tasks
   * **`add`**` Attend Meeting by: 12 Feb 11am` :
     adds the task `Attend Meeting` to the Task Manager
   * **`delete`**` 1` : deletes the task shown with index 1
   * **`exit`** : exits the app
&nbsp;

## 3. Features
Let us now explore the interesting features found in TypeTask!


### 3.1. Viewing Help : `help`
Having trouble navigating the application? Simply type `help` to view a summary of TypeTask’s commands.

Format:<br>
`help`<br>

### 3.2. Adding a Task: `add`, `a`, `+`
TypeTask supports 3 types of task. They are 1)floating task, 2)deadline task and 3)event task.

```
Things To Note:
> TypeTask will highlight the added task after an add command is executed.
> TypeTask will not detect duplicate task names.
> Task names should not contain symbols.
   e.g. "/", ".", ","
```

### 3.2.1. Adding a Floating Task: `add`, `a`, `+`
The first thing you would want to do is to add your first task! A floating is a simple task with no deadline or schedule.<br>
Let's make it simple by first adding a floating task. <br>


Format:<br>
`add <TASK NAME>`

Examples:

* `add CS2103T Meeting`
* `add Buy milk`


### 3.2.2. Adding a Deadline Task:  `add`, `a`, `+`
What if you want to submit a report by a certain date or time? You might then want to add a task with a deadline. <br>

Format:<br>
`add <TASK NAME> by:<DATE>`<br>
`add <TASK NAME> by:<TIME>`<br>
`add <TASK NAME> by:<DATE> <TIME>`<br>

```
Things To Note:
> TypeTask supports a wide range of formats for dates.
   e.g. "1/4/2001", "apr 2", "next weekend"
> TypeTask follows the USA date format (MM/DD/YYYY)
> Space must be used between words for dates.
   e.g "15 Oct", "next monday"
> Time is optional.
> Time can be in hh:mm format. 24 hours format is used.
> Time and Date must have a space in between them.
   e.g. "today 8pm", "15 Oct 11am"
```

Examples:

* `add CS2103T Meeting by: next week`
* `add Buy eggs by: 8pm`
* `add CS2103T Meeting by: next monday 11:10am`


### 3.2.3. Adding an Event Task:  `add`, `a`, `+`
You might also be interested in adding an event. Think of this as a task scheduled from and to an indicated time. <br>

Format:<br>
`add <TASK NAME> from:<DATE> to:<DATE>`<br>
`add <TASK NAME> from:<TIME> to:<TIME>`<br>
`add <TASK NAME> from:<DATE> <TIME> to:<DATE> <TIME>`<br>

```
Things To Note:
> Start Date/Time (Date/Time entered after "from:" 
  and End Date/Time (Date/Time entered after "to:") are compulsory.
> Start Date must be before End Date.
> TypeTask supports a wide range of formats for dates.
> TypeTask follows the USA date format (MM/DD/YYYY)
> Space must be used between words for Date. 
   e.g "15 Oct", "next monday"
> Time is optional.
> Time can be in hh:mm format. 24 hours format is used.
> Time and Date must have a space in between them.
   e.g. "today 8pm", "15 Oct 11am"

```

Examples:

* `add OPEN HOUSE from: 13 Oct to: 16 Oct`
* `add watch television from: 7pm to: 9pm`
* `add Meeting from: tuesday 12:00pm to: tuesday 2:00 pm`


### 3.2.4. Adding a Priority Task/Event :  `add`, `a`, `+`
What if you have tasks that are more important than others? You can add this task with a <img src="images/yellow_exclamation_mark.png" width="15"> label to indicate that the task has a high priority.

Format:<br>
`add <TASK NAME> p/<PRIORITY>`<br>
`add <TASK NAME> by:<DATE> <TIME> p/<PRIORITY>`<br>
`add <TASK NAME> from:<DATE> <TIME> to:<DATE> <TIME> p/<PRIORITY>`<br>

```
Things To Note:
> Priority is set as low by default if a task is added without
  the field “p/<PRIORITY>”.
> Priority can only be high or low.
> Priority can be applied to other types of tasks or events by
  adding this additional field: “p/<PRIORITY>”.
> Accepted words for <PRIORITY> are:
      High: High, high, h, Yes, YES, yes, y, Y
      Low: Low, low, l, No, NO, no, n, N, 
```

Examples:
* `add CS2103T Meeting p/high`
* `add Buy eggs by:next week 8pm p/h`
* `add Open House from:5 Nov 11:00am to: 6 Nov 11:00pm p/no`


### 3.3. Finding a Task: `find`, `f`, `search`
You may not want to scroll through your entire list of task just to find a certain task. Instead, you can easily do so by using the `find` command, followed by any keywords of your task.

Format:<br>
`find <KEYWORD>`<br>

```
Things To Note:
> The order of the keywords does not matter.
   e.g. 'Meeting Tutor' will match 'Tutor Meeting'  
> The tasks that match at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search).
   e.g. 'Meeting' will match 'Meeting Tutor'  
> The keyword is not case-sensitive.
   e.g. Meeting Tutor will match meeting tutor  
> If no date is specified, this function take the current day as reference.
> This function prioritises dates/time.
   e.g. "find tmr" will give a list of tasks with tomorrow's date 
         but will not return tasks with "tmr" in their names     
      > Therefore, avoid using digits to search for task names.
        TypeTask will return results based on time
        e.g. "find 4" will give a list of tasks due today at 0400h
        Instead of a list of tasks with "4" in their names.     
> This function does not support searching by months.
> This function will return the closest day from your current time.
   e.g. "find monday" will give you a list of tasks coming this Monday
```

Examples:
* `find Meeting`
* `find next week`
* `find tmr`


### 3.4. Editing a Task: `edit`
Sometimes you may want to change the details of a certain task you have. No need to worry! You can modify a certain task by typing the edit command.

Format:<br>
`edit INDEX <TASK NAME> by: <DATE> <TIME> p/<PRIORITY>`<br>
`edit INDEX from:<DATE> <TIME> to:<DATE> <TIME>`<br>
`edit INDEX from:<DATE> <TIME>`<br>
`edit INDEX to:<DATE> <TIME>`<br>

```
Things To Note:
> The edit command edits the task at the specified INDEX.
  The index refers to the number shown in the last task listing.
> The optional fields are <TASK NAME>, <DATE>, <TIME>, <PRIORITY>.
> The requirement is the presence of one of the optional fields.
> The existing field(s) will be updated with the input fields.
> TypeTask follows the USA date format (MM/DD/YYYY)
```

Examples:
* `edit 1 by:2 Dec 11:00am p/low`
What it does: Edit your task deadline to 2 Dec 11am and set the priority to low

* `edit 2 CS2103T Meeting`
What it does: Edit your task name to CS2103T Meeting

* `edit 3 from: next week to: next month`
What it does: Edit your task schedule to be from next week to next month

* `edit 4 from: next week`
What it does: Edit your task schedule start date to next week

* `edit 5 to: next month`
What it does: Edit your task schedule end date to next month


### 3.5. Removing Deadline from a Task: `removedeadline`, `rd`
What happens when there is a change to your deadline/schedule and yet are still unsure of the date? You can remove the 
deadline or schedule by using the `removedeadline` command.

Format:<br>
`removedeadline <INDEX>`

```
Things To Note:
> The task at the specified INDEX will have its deadline/schedule removed.
> The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
```


### 3.6. Deleting a Task : `delete`, `d`, `-`
There are some tasks that will never be completed and are irrelevant to keep. You can delete these tasks from your list by using the `delete` command.

Format:<br>
`delete <INDEX>`<br>

```
Things To Note:
> The task at the specified INDEX will be deleted.

## 4. FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?**<br>

 Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with
 the file that contains the data of your previous Task Manager folder.<br>
 
**Q: How do I transfer my data to another Computer through cloud service?**<br>
 1. On one computer, use the `setting` Command to change the default saving locaion to the local cloud service location. E.g. C:\Users\<Username of computer>\Google Drive<br>
 2. On your other computer, use the `use` Command to first import the data from the local cloud service location.<br>
 3. Before you start using the TypeTask on your other computers, use the `setting` Command to change the default saving location.<br>
 4. Edit away! Both of your computers will be able to see the updated file everytime you open them.<br>
