## 1. Introduction

Hi there, and nice to meet you!

My name is Tache, and I am a **task manager application** designed to serve busy people like you.
Have you ever felt stressed having to deal with a hectic schedule and numerous to-do tasks?
I am here to be your _virtual assistant_ and help you to manage all your deadlines and events. <br>

You are currently reading my user guide, which has been written to help you with:
* `Installing` me
* `Using` me
* `Troubleshooting` me


## 2. Getting Started

0. Ensure that you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.<br>

   > Unfortunately, having any Java 8 version is not enough because I cannot work with earlier versions of Java 8.

1. Download the latest `tache.jar` file from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as my home folder.
3. Double-click the file to start me! <br>

   > My Graphical User Interface (GUI) should appear in a few seconds:

   <img src="images/UiComponents.png" width="600"><br>
   _Figure 2.1. My GUI_

4. Type your desired command in my command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. <br>

   **Let's Try it Out!** <br>

   (Do the following steps in order)

   * **`add`** `Finish Progress Report by 13 apr 2pm` <br>

     > Adds a task with the following task details into your task list: <br>
     > Name: `Finish Progress Report` <br>
     > Due Date: `13 Apr` <br>
     > Due Time: `2 p.m.`

   * **`list`** <br>

     > Lists all your tasks. <br>
     Your task list should only contain 1 task, which is the task you added in the previous step (i.e. `Finish Progress Report`).

   * **`delete`** `1` <br>

     > Deletes your task `Finish Progress Report` with the task index `1`.

   * **`list`** <br>

     > Your task list should be empty now.

   * **`exit`**

     > Time for me to rest!

### 3.2. Add a task : `add`

Adds a task to your task list. <br>

#### To add a _floating_ task:

A floating task is a task that _does not have any specific times_. <br>
You are probably not sure when you are going to do it, nor are you sure when exactly it is due. <br>

An example of a floating task: <br>

* **A hobby-related activity or long-term goal**

  > You just want to record this task somewhere so that you can get to it when you are free someday. <br>

  **_E.g. Learn baking_**

Format: **`add`** `<task_name>` <br>

#### To add a _timed_ task:

A timed task is a task that _is associated with specific dates and times_. <br>
It can be a task with a deadline or an event. <br>

Format: **`add`** `<task_name> by <due date and time>` <br>
E.g. **`add`** `project proposal by 13 apr 2pm`<br>

Format: **`add`** `<task_name> from <start date and time> to <end date and time>` <br>
E.g. **`add`** `sushi restaurant promotion from 25 apr 10am to 28 apr 9pm`<br>

#### To add a _recurring_ task:

A recurring task is a task that has both start date and end date and has a specified recur interval<br>
Recurring tasks are _auto populated based on the specified recur interval_. <br>

Format: **`add`** `<task_name> from <start date and time> to <end date and time> <interval>` <br>
E.g. **`add`** `go to school from 9am to 5pm everyday`<br>

<img src="images/UiAddCommand.png" width="600"><br>
_Figure 3.2.1. Add Command_

For advanced users: **`a`** `<task_name>` <br>

### 3.3. List all tasks : `list`

Displays tasks in your task list.<br>
With this command, you will be able to list tasks of specific statuses in a _chronological order_.<br>

Some reasons why you might want to _list_ your tasks:

* **You want to prioritize your tasks based on the order of their specific dates / times** <br>

  > You want to have an overview of all your tasks based on how urgent they are, then
  manually select some of these tasks to focus on.

* **You want to track the tasks that you have already completed** <br>

* **You want to plan your time to get your remaining tasks done** <br>

* **You want to schedule some of your uncompleted [floating tasks](#to-add-a-floating-task)** <br>

  > Converting your floating tasks into [timed tasks](#to-add-a-timed-task) will allow me to keep track of
  them more effectively (e.g. by alerting you when they are overdue).
  > Fun fact: you can know the _no. of floating and timed tasks_ you have instantly through my GUI!

	<img src="images/TaskCount.png" width="100"><br>
	_Figure 3.3.1. Task Count_

Format: **`list`** <br>
This lists all your uncompleted tasks. <br>

Format: **`list`** `<filter>`<br>
E.g. **`list`** `completed`, **`list`** `all`, **`list`** `floating`, **`list`** `timed`, **`list`** `overdue`, **`list`** `today`, **`list`** `this week`<br>

<img src="images/UiListCommand.png" width="600"><br>
_Figure 3.3.2. List Command_

For advanced users: **`l`** `<filter>` <br>

### 3.4. Find a task : `find`

Finds uncompleted and overdue task(s) whose details(s) contain `<keyword>` with one margin of error. <br>

> For example, **`find`** `<homwork>` can help you search for a task named `do probability homework`.
Similarly, a task named `programming hoework` (notice the spelling error), will also be found.<br>

> **`find`** can also be used to look for dates, time and tags<br>

A reason why you might want to _find_ a task:

* **You want to know the [task details](#task-details) of a task** <br>

  > Such task details include the duration of a task, the deadline of a task etc.

  E.g. **Finding out when your _project proposal_ is due** <br>
  You want to plan your schedule for the week, taking into account the proposal deadline.

Format: **`find`** `<keyword>` <br>

<img src="images/UiFindCommand.png" width="600"><br>
_Figure 3.4.1. Find Command_

For advanced users: **`f`** `<keyword>` <br>

### 3.5. Edit a task : `edit`

Edits 1 or more [task details](#task-details) of a task. <br>

An example of a task you might want to _edit_: <br>

* **A task that has already exceeded its deadline**

  > You still want to complete a certain task, but you intend to postpone its deadline. <br>

  **_E.g. Buy aunt's birthday present_** <br>
  You have unfortunately already missed her birthday, but you still want to give her a
  belated birthday present the next time you meet her.

Format: **`edit`** `<task_index> change <task_detail> to <new_value>` <br>
This command will direct me to make the specified update to a task with `<task_index>`. <br><br>
Format: **`edit`** `<task_index> change <task_detail_1> to <new_value1> and <task_detail_2> to <new_value2> and ...`<br>
E.g. **`edit`** `4 change start_date to 24 apr and end_date to 27 apr` <br>
You can edit more task details for your task concurrently using the above format.<br>

**Special Notes**<br>
>`<task_detail>` can be used interchangeably with no special characters or initials for better convenience <br>
>E.g. `start_date` can be replaced with `startdate` or `sd`<br>
>`recur_interval` can be replaced with `recurinterval` or `ri`<br>

>Tasks are non editable if they are part of a recurring task, however the<br>master recurring task (denoted with an R in the task list panel) can be edited.<br>
><img src="images/MasterRecur.png" width="200"><br>


<img src="images/UiEditCommand.png" width="600"><br>
_Figure 3.5.1. Edit Command_

For advanced users:<br>**`e`** `<task_index> change <task_detail_1> to <new_value1> and <task_detail_2> to <new_value2> and ...` <br><br>
For advanced users:<br>**`e`** `<task_index>; <task_detail_1> <new_value_1>; <task_detail_2> <new_value_2>; ...` <br>

### 3.6. Delete a task : `delete`

Removes a specified task from your task list.<br>

An example of a task that you might want to _delete_:

* **A tasks that no longer needs to be done** <br>

  E.g. **_Do financial report_** <br>
  Your supervisor had delegated the wrong task to you and has just corrected his mistake.

Format: **`delete`** `<task_index>` <br>
To delete all your tasks, you can type in **`clear`** instead. <br>

**Special Note**<br>
>Tasks can not be deleted if they are part of a recurring task, however the<br>master recurring task (denoted with an R in the task list panel) can be deleted.<br>
><img src="images/MasterRecur.png" width="200"><br>

For advanced users: **`d`** `<task_index>` <br>

### 3.7. Select a task : `select`

Selects a task for you to see it at the calendar view. <br>

A reason why you might want to _select_ a task:

* **You want to view your task in relation to the other tasks you have for the month** <br>

  > This will guide you in planning your schedule for the next few weeks. <br>

Format: **`select`** `<task_index>` <br>

<img src="images/UiSelectCommand.png" width="600"><br>
_Figure 3.7.1. Select Command_

For advanced users: **`s`** `<task_index>` <br>

### 3.8. Complete a task : `complete`

Marks a task as done. <br>

A reason why you might want to _complete_ a task:

Format: **`complete`** `<task_index>`<br>
E.g. **`complete`** `1` <br><br>
Format: **`complete`** `<task_index1>,<task_index2>,<task_index3>,...`<br>
E.g. **`complete`** `1,2,3,4` <br>
You can complete multiple tasks simultaneously using the above format.<br>

<img src="images/UiCompleteCommand.png" width="600"><br>
_Figure 3.8.1. Complete Command_

For advanced users: **`c`** `<task_index>` <br>

### 3.9. Undo a change : `undo`

Undoes the last change made to my data. <br>

A reason why you might want to _undo_ a previous command:

* **You edited the wrong details of a task by mistake** <br>

  > It is too much of a hassle for you to manually correct your error by editing the task again.

Format: **`undo`** <br>

<img src="images/UiUndoCommand.png" width="600"><br>
_Figure 3.9.1. Undo Command_

### 3.12. Change data file location

Modifies the file path of my data file. <br>
Future modifications of my task list will be saved at this new location. <br>

A reason why you might want to _change my data file location_:

* **You want to [sync](#sync) my task list and access it from other devices** <br>

  > You can choose to store my data file in a local folder controlled by a cloud
  syncing device (e.g. Dropbox) so that you can access my data from multiple computers.

Format: **`save`** `<new_save_location_directory>` <br>
This command directs me to set my new data file in a `<new_save_location_directory>`,

## 5. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

Here are some questions that you might want to ask me:

**Q**: How do I _transfer my data_ to another computer? <br>
**A**: Install me in the other computer and _overwrite the empty data file_ I create with
       the file that contains the data of your previous Task Manager folder. Alternatively,
       you can type in **`load`** `<file_path>`, to load your data file.

**Q**: How do I add an _event_? <br>
**A**: Type in **`add`** `<task> from <start date and time> to <end date and time>` as mentioned
[here](#32-add-a-task--add).

**Q**: How do I retrieve my _previous commands_? <br>
**A**: Use the arrow keys <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> to get your previous commands.

**Q**: Is there any way I can _type my commands faster_? <br>
**A**: Yes, I _autocomplete_ all commands. Every command can also be replaced with the first letter of
its name. For example, you can replace "add" with just "a".

**Q**: How do I get reminded of the tasks I have to do? <br>
**A**: I will automatically trigger a system tray notification whenever one of your tasks is starting or due in 2 hours, as mentioned [here](#315-system-tray-notification).
