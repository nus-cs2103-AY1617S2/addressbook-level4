### 3.2 Adding a task: `add`

#### Now you are ready to start exploring KIT. Try adding a task!

Description: Adds a task to KIT. New tasks are `not done` by default. <br>

Format: `add NAME [r/REMARKS] [s/STARTDATE] [e/ENDDATE] [l/LOCATION] [t/TAG]...`

> * If you need to type the character / anywhere in the input, put a \ before it to avoid problems such as, t/ getting recognized as tag. eg. carrot\/cabbage <br>
> * Tasks can contain any number of tags (including 0).

Here are some examples:

* `add do 2103 project r/waiting for johnâ€™s reply e/next tuesday l/nus soc t/school`
* `add buy presents s/two week before christmas e/christmas eve l/town t/shopping`
* `add buy groceries r/cabbage and broccoli s/this weekend t/personal`

	##### Notice how `cat/dog` is correctly captured and displayed.
    > <img src="images/addCommand.png" width="600">

#### Supported Date/Time formats:

KIT has an intelligent processer that interprets your phrases and sentences about time, date and deadline.

Here is a table of interpretation for your convenience.

| Date Format | Example |KIT's interpretation  |
|-------------------|----------|------------------|
|Month/day           | 10/19         | Oct 19 of the current year |
|Day Month  | 6 Apr         | Apr 6 of the current year|
|Month Day  | Apr 6         | Apr 6 of the current year  |
|Day of the Week| Mon, Monday| The upcoming Monday |
|Relative date| Yesterday, today, tomorrow, two weeks from now         | Corresponding dates relative to today
|Holidays | New Year, Christmas| The dates of the holiday of the current year|

> * If you are adding a date of the current year, you can leave out the year because dates without specified year are assumed to be **the current year**. *See the first 3 entries of the  Date Format Table*
> * You can input time as HH:mm in 24 hour format or hh:mm am/pm.
> * Times without am/pm are assumed to be in 24 hour format.
> * You may include both date and time, date only, time only or even none at all.


### 3.3.1 Listing of task: `list`

##### You can use the flexible list command to view tasks that match certain criteria.

Description: Shows a list of tasks in KIT depending on chosen criterion. <br>

Format: `list [CRITERION]`, `ls [CRITERION]`, `l [CRITERION]`

#### Available Criteria

`done` : display the list of all tasks that are done.
`notdone` or `undone` : display the list of all tasks that are not done.
`floating` or `float` : display the list of all tasks that have no start date and no end date.

If no criterion is specified, all tasks will be listed.

Examples:
* `ls` : display all task.
* `list done` : display all done task.
* `l notdone` : display all notdone task.
* `ls float` : display all floating task.

### 3.3.2 Listing of all task under a tag: `list tag`

#### We shouldn't mix personal life with work. KIT understands that.

If you want to see all tasks with a particular tag only, say `work`, you can use the `list tag` function.

Description: Shows a list of task by the specified tag. <br>

Format: `list tag TAGNAME`, `ls tag TAGNAME`, `l tag TAGNAME`

Example:

`list tag work`

This displays all task with the tag `work`.

### 3.4	Marking a task as done: `done`

#### Congratulations on completing your first task!
Now that you have completed a task, you can mark it as done by using the `done` function.

Description: Marks the task at the specified `INDEX` as "Done". <br>

Format: `done INDEX`, `d INDEX`

> * The index refers to the number shown beside the task name.
> * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

> <img src="images/doneBefore.png" width="600">
> <img src="images/doneAfter.png" width="600">

>Tip : You can use the `list done` or `list` command to see the tasks you have marked as done. Task with green names and a tick are done tasks.

### 3.5	Marking a task as undone: `undone`

#### More follow ups for your task? Need to resume a completed task?

You can easily mark it as "Not Done" again.

Description: Marks the task at the specified `INDEX` as "Not Done". <br>

Format: `undone INDEX`, `notdone INDEX`, `ud INDEX`, `nd INDEX`

> * The index refers to the number shown beside the task name.
> * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

##### Note: Repeated or multiple `done` or `undone` on the same task does not change it's status, i.e. `done` an already done task does not change it's status.

### 3.6	Deleting a task: `delete`
#### Don't want the old tasks to take up all the space?

If you would like to remove a task from KIT, simply use the `delete` function.

Description: Deletes the task with specified index from KIT.<br>

Format: `delete INDEX`

> * Deletes the task with the specified `INDEX`.
> * The index refers to the index number shown in the listing.
> * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:

* `delete 2`<br>
Deletes the task with index `2` in the current listing in KIT.


### 3.7.1 Undoing a command: `undo`

#### Made a mistake? No worries.

You can retract it by using the `undo` command.

Description: Undo the last command.<br>

Format: `undo`, `uhoh`

 * Able to undo up to 10 times.
 * Able to undo any command that modifies data. List, find commands are ignored.

### 3.7.2 Redoing a command: `redo`

#### Along with undo comes redo.

Just in case you changed your mind, you can also reverse your `undo` by using the `redo` command.

Description: Redo the last undo. <br>

Format: `redo`

> * Able to redo up to 10 times.
> * If you make any new commands right after you undo, you will not be able to do any more redo.

Undo and Redo basically works similarly to the page back and page forward button in your browser.


### 3.8 Editing a task: `edit`

#### Schedules change all the time, and in KIT you can, too.

The `edit` command allows you to edit the details of a task.

Description: Edits an existing task in KIT. <br>

Format: `edit INDEX [NAME] [r/REMARKS] [s/STARTDATE] [e/ENDDATE] [l/LOCATION] [t/TAG]...`

> * At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
> * Existing values will be updated to the input values.
> * When editing tags, the existing tags of the task will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
> * You can remove all the taskâ€™s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.

Examples:

* `edit 1 r/doing edit command l/home`<br>
  Edits the remark and location of the 1st task to be `finish up user guide` and `home` respectively.
  >  <img src="images/editBefore.png" width="600">
  >  <img src="images/editAfter.png" width="600">


### 3.9.1 Finding a task: `find`

#### Finding a task in a stack of tasks can be troublesome.
KIT has an efficient `find` command that can help. Use it along with any keyword or date you can recall that is related to that task.

Description: Finds task whose names or remark contains the given keywords.<br>

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`, `f KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

> * The search is case insensitive. e.g `project` will match `Project`
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `do project` will match `project do`
> * All fields of the task are searched, i.e. name, remark and etc, basically every detail of the task is being searched.
> * Substrings will be matched. e.g. `project` will match `projects`
> * Task matching **every** keyword will be found.
    e.g. keywords `biology project` will match the task of `do biology project` and not the task of `do physics project`(_does not contain `biology`_).

Examples:

* `find homework`<br>

* `find poster Apr 6`<br>

 >  <img src="images/findAfter.png" width="600">

### 3.9.2 Finding with exact keyword(s):`findexact`

#### What if you want to search for something more specific?

`findexact` allows you to do that.

Description: Finds task that contains words that are **full matches** of all the keyword(s). <br>

Format: `findexact KEYWORD...`, `fexact KEYWORD...`, `finde KEYWORD...`, `fe KEYWORD...`

> * The search is the similar to `find` except it **does not** search for substring matches and **does not** search for dates.
e.g `do project` will match `do School project` but not `do School projects` (_`projects` does not match `project`_)

### 3.10 Google Calendar.

#### Google Calendar is popular, and KIT knows.

KIT provides support for Google Calendar users.

To use Google Calendar with KIT, we first require your permission for access to your Google Calendar. <strong>Note: Google Calendar related commands requires the internet and a Google Calendar account to work.</strong>

> * The request will automatically open in your default browser.
> * Log in to your Google account and approve our request to access your calendar.
> * You only need to do this for the first time.

### 3.10.1 Import events from Google Calendar: `gg`

#### Do you have to copy and paste your events from Google Calendar? Of course not!

You can import your google calendar with the `getgoogle` command.

Description: Add your <strong>upcoming</strong> Events from your Google Calendar to KIT. <br>

Format: `getgoogle`, `gg`
 >  <img src="images/ggBefore.png" width="600">
 >  <img src="images/ggAfter.png" width="600">

> * This command will only grab upcoming Events and ignore duplicate Events.

### 3.10.2 Post Task to Google Calendar: `pg`

#### Similarly, you can keep Google Calendar updated with KIT.

With `postgoogle`, you are able to add a task from KIT as an Event to your Google Calendar. It also updates tasks that are added before.

Description: Add or update the specified task to your Google Calendar. <br>

Format: `postgoogle [INDEX]`, `pg [INDEX]`

> * If INDEX is specified and correct, adds/updates the selected task to calendar.
> * If INDEX is not specified, adds/updates **all** displayed tasks to calendar.
> * This will not add any duplicate tasks to your google calendar.
> * **Note**: Any events in a calendar will have both start and end dates. Similarly only tasks with start and end dates can be added to your google calendar.

### 3.10.3 Adding a task with smart add: `smartadd`

##### Typing prefixes is too troublesome? Try `smartadd`.

You can add a new event to *both* your calendar and KIT using`smartadd`. This command is flexible and allows you to add a task's location and date details without using the prefixes.

Description: Flexibly adds a task without specifying prefixes for date and location to both KIT and your calendar.

Format: sa DESCRIPTION [r/REMARK] [t/TAG]...

> * DESCRIPTION is where you can specify the task name, location and date details.

Example:

* `sa meet friends for dinner in clementi at 6pm t/friends`

> <img src="images/smartAddCommand1.png" width="600">

* `sa project meeting at 2pm`
* `sa design poster with team in meeting room r/share my new ideas with team`

> <img src="images/smartAddCommandAll.png" width="600">

Some tips for using the Smart Add command:

* If you enter a time with no date, the closest date in the future will be used.
    * If the time is later today, the date will be today.
    * If the time has passed for today, the date will be tomorrow.
* If no start or end time is entered, an all day event will be created.
* If no end time is entered, the event is assumed to be one hour long.
* You can specify start and end time using time ranges or time intervals. These two commands are equivalent:
    * `sa watch movie 3pm for 2 hours`
    * `sa watch movie 3pm-5pm`

<strong>Note: KIT will give the best interpretation of the given description, however, this may not always be accurate, especially for ambiguous descriptions.</strong>

For example, `sa Meeting at Wednesday Cafe`.

In this case, either _'Wednesday Cafe'_ is the actual location and the date is not specified. Or, it could also be interpreted as meeting on Wednesday at _'Cafe'_.

If the input is ambiguous, we recommend you to use the add command to clearly specify the location, date and etc.

### 3.11 Clearing all task: `clear`

#### Need a clean slate to start over?
Just use `clear`.

Description: Clears all entries from KIT. <br>

Format: `clear`

You can do so using the `save` function.

Description: Specify location of save file. <br>

Format: `save PATHNAME`

### 3.15 Changing the appearance of KIT

#### If you want to have a bit more colors, KIT can do that too!
`changetheme` allows you to change the colors and appearances of KIT.

Description: Changes the theme of KIT to the requested theme.

##### Notice the above screenshot is of a default theme, and the one below is of a light theme.
Format: `changetheme [THEMENAME]`
 >  <img src="images/changeThemeBefore.png" width="600">
 >  <img src="images/changeThemeAfter.png" width="600">


> * After each successful `changetheme` command, you will have to restart KIT to view the changes.
> * If THEMENAME is specified and correct, KIT will change its theme and after restart you will see the changed theme.
> * KIT currently supports three themes: Default, Light and Dark.

### 3.16 Using shortcuts

#### Feeling lazy to type the whole commands? Use KIT's shortcuts.

In KIT, we provide shortcuts which are activated with different keyboard combinations.

Description: Fills the command box with specific command.

Example format: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>
This will fill the command box with "add ".

> * Shortcuts is temporary disabled when you are using google calendar as it is opened in a separate window. Click on KIT to use shortcuts again!

## 4. FAQ

**Q**: _Does KIT support Windows 10? <br>_
**A**: Yes! KIT works as long as you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later.

**Q**: _Will my tasks be saved after I close the application?  <br>_
**A**: Yes. Your data is saved after every command, so you can safely exit KIT when you are done. There is not need to manually save your data.

**Q**: _Can I have two tasks with the same name?  <br>_
**A**: Sure, tasks with same names are allowed, as long as at least one of their fields is different. That being said, tasks with completely same details are not allowed. Completely same details refer to same name, location, start date, end date and remark.

**Q**: _I accidentally created two exact same tasks, how do I remove just one of them?  <br>_
**A**: If you just added the task,meaning the most recent command is the add command, you can do so by typing undo. Otherwise, you can use [find](#391-finding-a-taskfind) or [list](#331-listing-of-task-list) to search for the duplicate tasks and [delete](#36-deleting-a-task-delete) one of them. The other task will remain in KIT. Instructions on these commands can be found in the respective section of the commands.

**Q**: _Can I manually edit the storage file?  <br>_
**A**: Yes, you can. It is a xml file called kit.xml. It can be found under data\kit.xml by default. Be careful in making changes to it if you are unfamiliar with XML, KIT will not be able to read your data if the format is invalid and will start with an empty KIT.

**Q**: _I use two computers. Can I transfer my data between the two computers? <br>_
**A**: Yes, you can! Your data are saved in a file called kit.xml. Just copy this file to your computer and place in under data\kit.xml. You can change the file location later using the [save](#3132-saving-the-data) command.

**Q**: _Itâ€™s troublesome to constantly transfer my data between two computers, is there any way for it to synchronize automatically?  <br>_
**A**: Sorry, we currently do not support automatical synchronization. However, if you are using Dropbox, you can specify folders that will automatically synchronize through Dropbox. This means that you can use the [save](#3132-saving-the-data) command to specify your save location in your Dropbox folder and thus get synchronization.
