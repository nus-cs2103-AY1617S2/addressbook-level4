### Adding a task
Work can be stressful and overwhelming. We are being bombarded with information at home, in school and at work. It is natural to forget things from time to time and panic whenever the submission date is near. That being said, it is important for us to learn how to organize and manage the tasks at hand. However in iManager, things are made easier for you. <br>

iManager, offers you flexibility to customized your tasks such that it is easily understood in one glance. A typical task may contain either a duration, deadline or none of the previous two (i.e. floating task).  Let us now learn how to add a customize task to iManager.

#### Adding a task with duration

Format: `add NAME from STARTDATE to ENDDATE  [t/TAG...]`
