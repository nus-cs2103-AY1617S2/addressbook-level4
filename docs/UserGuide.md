## 1. Introduction 
Welcome. We will take you for an enthralling journey as we bring forward our task manager `TaskCrusher`.

It can help you manage events, deadlines, add tasks with or without deadlines or view your history. This is a great manager if you are looking to move away from clicking as the simplified scheduling is just a few short and sweet command lines away.

## 2. Quick Start

0. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.<br>

   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
   > This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

1. Download the latest `TaskCrusher.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for TaskCrusher.
3. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
4. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. <br>
   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window.
   
5. Some example commands you can try:
   * **`help`** : displays help documentation
   * **`adde`:**  `add "Cs2103 meeting" 3 Mar 17:00 to 18:00` adds an event called "Cs2103 meeting" on 3 March from 17:00 to 18:00
   * **`view`**: `view calendar` displays the calendar with tasks and events you have added

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.<br>

## 3. Features

> **Command Format**
>
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters.
> * Items in `SQUARE_BRACKETS` are optional.
> * Items surrounding `|` means we only choose one of them (OR).
> * Items with `...` after them can have multiple instances.
> * Parameters should be in the order stated (at least for now).

### 3.1. Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

> Help is also shown if you enter an incorrect command e.g. `abcd`

### 3.2. Adding an item: `adde` or `addt`

Format (event):

`adde "event name" START_DATE START_TIME to [END_DATE] END_TIME [t/TAG]... [//DESCRIPTION]`<br>

Format (tentative event. blocks multiple time slots): 

`adde "event name" START_DATE START_TIME to [END_DATE] END_TIME or ... [t/TAG]... [//DESCRIPTION]`<br>

Format (task with deadline): 

`addt "task name" DEADLINE [t/TAG] [p/PRIORITY] [//DESCRIPTION]`  <br>

Format (task without deadline): 

`addt "task name" [t/TAG] [p/PRIORITY] [//DESCRIPTION] `<br>

Examples:

* `adde "Cs2103 meeting" 3 Mar 17:00 to 18:00`
* `addt "Buy tickets" 3 mar 17:00`
* `addt "Take GF for dinner"`

### 3.3 Viewing the active/expired list: `list`

**View the entire active list**: 

Format: `list`

**View tasks with/without deadline**: 

Format: `listd [DEADLINE] [SORT_FIELD]`

Example:

* `listd 3 March`

**View events within a time frame, or with no time frame specified** : 

Format: `liste [START_DATE START_TIME to END_DATE END TIME] [SORT_FIELD]`

Example:

* `liste today 17:00 to tomorrow 18:00`

**View overdue task** : 

Format: `listo`

**View tasks and events in the expired list**: 

Format: `listc`

NOTE:
> note that tasks and events have different fields, and therefore the parameter SORT_FIELD may vary between events and tasks.

### 3.4 Updating a field of a task/event in the active list : `edit`

> User can edit the fields of the tasks and events in the active list by using their indexes specified in the most recent list. The steps are therefore as follows:

1. Use `list` command
2. Using the index, call `edit INDEX etc.`

**Updating the fields**:

Format: `edit INDEX FIELD_NAME NEW_VALUE`

Examples: 

`edit 1 priority 3`, assuming that the item with index 1 is a task.

### 3.5 Mark as `done` or dimiss tasks and events: `done` and `dis`
> Just like the `edit` command, the user makes use of the index provided by the `list`-type commands. Either way, the task/event gets stored in the expired list.

**Marking a task or event as done**:

Format: `done INDEX`

**Dismissing a task or event, without actually completing**:

Format: `dis INDEX [\\REASON]`

Example:

`dis 2 \\dropped the module so no longer need to complete this assignment`

### 3.6. Finding event or task by keyword: `find`

> Finds tasks or events whose field(s) contain any of the given keywords.<br>

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Examples:

* `find cs2103`<br>
  Returns any task or event pertaining to cs2103

### 3.7. Deleting a task/event without moving it to the expired list: `delete`

> Just like edit, user can delete tasks and events in the active list by using their indexes specified in the most recent list. This option can also be used for tasks or events already in the expired list from which the user wants to get rid of.

Format: `delete INDEX`

### 3.8. Clearing all expired tasks and events : `clear`

Format: `clear`

### 3.9 Viewing other material: `view`

**View command history**:

Format: `exit`

### 3.11 Undoing the last command: `undo`

Format: `undo`

### 3.12 Recycle 

Brings back the expired tasks/events back to active list, with the deadline/event date altered.The index is as shown by `listc` command.

Format : `Recycle INDEX DEADLINE | START_DATE START_TIME to [END_DATE] END_TIME`
