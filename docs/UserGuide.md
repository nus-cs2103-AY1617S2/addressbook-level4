#### 3.2.1. Events

Events added into the task manager are sorted by their start time. Events with earlier start date and time will be located at the top and later start date and time at the bottom of the event tasks pane.

#### 3.2.1.1. Same Day Events
These are events that end within the same day(duration of a day or lesser).<br>

There are two formats:

Format: `ADD` task `ON` date/day <br />
> In this format where only a date/day is provided, start and end time will be automatically assigned as:
> * Start Time : 0000hrs
> * End Time   : 2359 hrs

Format: `ADD` task `ON` date/day time `TO` time <br />
> In this format, start or end time can be omitted and the fields will be automatically assigned. <br>
> Without specified start time, it will be automatically assigned as:
> * Start Time : 0000hrs
>
> Without a specified end time, it will be automatically assigned as:
> * End Time   : +1hr buffer from start time <br />

> If one hour buffer goes into the next day, End date will be changed to next day and time will be changed accordingly.


#### 3.2.1.2. Multiple Days Events
Format: `ADD` task `FROM` date/day time `TO` date/day time <br />
> Same start and end date cannot be used for this format. If a same day event is required, use one day event format. <br>
> Without specified start or end time, start and/or end time will be automatically assigned as:
> * Start Time : 0000hrs
> * End Time   : 2359 hrs

Sample Event:
