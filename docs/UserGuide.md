## 4. FAQ

**Q**: Why does the app not run even though I have Java 8 installed?
<br>
**A**: Ensure you have Java version 1.8.0_60 or later installed in your Computer. This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

**Q**: Can I control each of the panels individually?
<br>
**A**: No, all 3 panels are controlled together, meaning a `listdone` command will list all completed events, floating tasks, and deadlines in all 3 panels respectively.

**Q**: Can I resize each of the panels individually?
<br>
**A**: Yes, you can adjust their horizontal width just as you would a typical window.

**Q**: Can I change a task into a deadline, event, or vice versa?
<br>
**A**: Yes, just update the task's `END_DATETIME` for deadlines and its `START_DATETIME` for events.

**Q**: Can I change the order of display?
<br>
**A**: No, the tasks are always listed in chronological order, starting from today.

**Q**: How do I save the data?
<br>
**A**: Task manager data are saved in the hard disk automatically (in XML format) after any command that changes the data.

**Q**: Can I edit the saved data directly in XML?
<br>
**A**: Yes, the app will update accordingly when you launch it.

**Q**: Can I quit without using the exit command?
<br>
**A**: You can quit however you prefer since all changes are automatically saved.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous task manager folder.
