> `undo`. If loading a different data file with `load` cause the current tasks to be changed, you can go back
> to the previous task using `undo` too (Using `undo`, however, won't revert the change of data storage 
path. It's not considered modifications to the task).
> Changes that are not modifications to the tasks in the todo list cannot be reversed with `undo`. However, 
> you can still easily revert their effects:
>   * Change of storage path location (due to `save` / `load` ) - You can change your storage path to the 
previous location with `save`.
>   * Setting of aliases (due to `alias`) - You can remove the alias with `unalias`.
>   * Removal of aliases (due to `unalias`) - You can set back the alias with `alias`.
>
> Note that commands that commands that do not modifies the content of the todo list cannot be undone with 
> `undo`. E.g
> If a number is entered, undoes that amount of previous commands instead.

Examples:

* `add Test`<br>
  `undo`<br>
  Undo adding Test to the todo list.
* `add Assignment` <br>
  `add Project` <br>
  `undo 2`<br>
  Undo both commands.

### 3.13. Redo a command : `redo`

For when you accidentally undo a correct command.<br>
Redo previously undone commands by the user.<br>
Format: `redo [NUMBER]`

> Similar to `undo`, `redo` will help you re-apply modifications to the tasks in the todo list that 
> you mistakenly revoked (using `undo`).<br>
> If a number is entered, redo that amount of previous commands instead.<br>
> The number must be less than or equal to the number of commands undone.

Examples:

* `add Test`<br>
  `undo`<br>
  `redo` <br>
  Redo adding Test to the todo list.
