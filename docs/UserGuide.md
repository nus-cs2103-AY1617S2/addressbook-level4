## 3. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? <br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with
       the file that contains the data of your previous Task Scheduler folder.

<a name="timeInput"/></a>
**Q**: What date time format is allowed? <br>
**A**: The input of date time can be done using natural language. Input such as "9am next monday" or "25 of next month" 
can be recognized. However, when you want to specify 2 dates in TIME for a event, you must use "to" to separate 2 dates.
Besides, formatted input with ambiguity of month and day can cause an error in time stored, so input such as "02/06/2017" or "08.06.1997"
should not be used. It will be safe to always use name of the month, e.g. "January" instead of "01".

## 4. Known Bugs in Application

### Adding tasks with same title 
> When marking one of the tasks as done then deleting the undone one, <br>
> the done task gets deleted instead<br>
> Tasks of the same title will have indexing problems
