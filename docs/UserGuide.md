<br>


### 3.2 Editing a task: `edit / e`
---
_**Edits a particular task by <u>specifying its index</u> and <u> new information to be updated</u>.**_<br>

#### Format:

**`edit INDEX [NEWTASKNAME] [p/NEWPRIORITY] [s/NEWSTARTDATE] [d/NEWDUEDATE] [f/NEWFREQUENCY] [t/NEWTAGNAME]...`**

<br>

> - Clear a task's field (except task name) by inputting the right prefix only.<br>
> - The **`FREQUENCY`** cannot be in the task when both the **`STARTDATE`** and **`DUEDATE`** are not available.<br><br>

<br>

#### Example:

This task has just been added at `INDEX` 1 with the `add` command:

 **`add Buy milk p/1 t/NTUC`**<br>

You can now edit the task in several ways:<br>

* Change the task name:<br>

**`edit 2 f/`**<br>

<br>

### 3.3 Selecting a task: `select`
---
_**Marks the status of task at a specified index.**_<br>

#### Format:

> - From the list of uncompleted tasks (by typing `list`), when a task is selected, the status column will show a hammer icon (indicating that the task is completing in progress.<br><br>
> - From the list of uncompleted tasks (by typing `list`), you can remove the hammer icon by typing `select INDEX [INDEX]...`.<br><br>
> - From the list of completed tasks (by typing `done`), you cannot select a task to set its status because the status column shows a tick icon (indicating that the task is completed) by default.<br><br>

<br>

#### Example:

* Select the task at `INDEX` 1 as completing in progress:<br>
**`select 1`** <br>

<br>

#### Example:

* Mark the task at `INDEX` 1 as done:<br>

> - Once a task is deleted, it will be removed from the task list.<br><br>

<br>

#### Example:

* Deletes the task at indexes 4, 5 and 6:
**`k 4 5 6`** <br>

<br>


### 3.6 Sorting a list of tasks: `sort / s`
---
_**Sorts the list of tasks by the specified field according to the specified ordering.**_ <br>

#### Format:

**`sort FIELD [ORDER]`**

<br>

> **`FIELD`** can be any of the following:<br>
