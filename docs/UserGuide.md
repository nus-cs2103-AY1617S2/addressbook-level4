## 1. Quick Start

0. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.<br>

      > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
      > This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

1. Download the latest `opus.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.

2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Task Manager.

3. Double-click the file to start the app. The graphical user interface (GUI) should appear in a few seconds.
   > <img src="images/Ui.png" width="600">

   The GUI has four main components: `Main Panel`, `Side Panel`, `Command Bar` and `Feedback Panel`.

   - `Main Panel` displays a list of all existing tasks sorted in a way that incomplete tasks will appear before the completed tasks.
   - `Side Panel` displays a list of incomplete tasks that you need to complete within the current week.
   - `Command Bar` allows you to type the commands to perform actions that you desire.
   - `Feedback Panel` displays the result of the executed command. If it is an invalid command, it will display an error message together with the correct command format that you are supposed to input.

4. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. <br>
   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window.

5. Let's have a look at how Jim, an avid Opus fan, utilises the task manager:
   * **`add`**` Do laundry p/low b/12/31/2017 12:00` : Jim wants to do laundry at noon, so he adds it to the task manager.
   * **`list`** : Jim wants to get back to the overview of his list of tasks.
   * **`sort`**` priority` : Jim wants to see the most urgent tasks at the top of his list.
   * **`mark`**` 1` : Jim realises he has completed the 1st task so he marks it as completed
   * **`delete`**` 3` : Jim realises he does not have to complete the 3rd task so he deletes it from his current list.
   * **`find`**` laundry` : Jim gets a call from his mum that the laundry must be completed by 3pm so he does a search for it.
   * **`edit`**` 1 p/hi` : Jim updates the priority of the found laundry task to high.
   * **`exit`** : Jim is done for the day so he decides to exit the application!
