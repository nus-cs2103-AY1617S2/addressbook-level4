# Test script for manual testing

## Loading sample data for KIT

1. Ensure that you put `SampleData.xml` inside the `data/ManualTesting/` folder.
2. Start `KIT.jar` by double clicking it.
3. Type `load data/ManualTesting/SampleData.xml`.

## Loading sample data for Google Calendar
Any Google Calendar related commands require proper credentials. This will open a request on the default browser. This is only needed for the first time.

You can use the google calander account we created for testing. There are some events already in the calendar.

 Username: **`jimkeepsittidy@gmail.com`**
 Password: **** (password is in testscript.md uploaded to ivle)

### Brief Introduction:
In the sample data, there are 50 pre-loaded tasks. 30 task are `undone` and 20 task are `done`.

`undone` tasks are shown by default. 30 `undone` tasks will be shown when first loading up KIT. By **typing** `list` in the command box, all 50 tasks will be shown in the task list column.

`Done` task's name will be green and a tick will appear beside the task name. Task names that are not green in colour are `undone` task.

If google calander is not needed, simply click and drag the middle bar slider loacted at the center to the right to hide the login page.

## Date and Time format

##### Before proceeding to add a task into KIT, do take a look at the table that shows the date format supported by KIT. KIT supports many formats for date input.

| Words           | 1 Oct 2017           |
| Month Day       | Oct 1                |
| Day of the week | Wed, Wednesday       |
| Relative date   | today, tomorrow, next wed |

* If no year is specified, it is assumed to be the current year.
* The day of the week refers to the following week. For example, today is Sunday (30 Oct). will interpret Wednesday and Sunday as 2 Nov and 6 Nov respectively (a week from now).


<br>

| Time Format     | Example(s)                              |

| Relative time   | this morning, this afternoon, tonight, am, pm   |

* Tasks can be entered without a time input.
