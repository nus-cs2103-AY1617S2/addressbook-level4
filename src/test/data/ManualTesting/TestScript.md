# Test Script for Manual Testing

## Loading ProcrastiNomore with sample data

Ensure that you have the file `SampleData.xml` inside the `/src/test/data/ManualTesting` folder.
Open the SampleData.xml file and copy the contents into the taskmanager.xml file in the src/data folder.

If the taskmanager.xml file does not exist, create a new xml file with the file name "taskmanager" then
copy the content from the SampleData.xml file over.

Run the MainApp.java file as a Java application. This will prompt the application to run and the ProcrastiNomore
UI will appear.

If the sample data will copied over correctly, the task manager will have a total of 51 tasks inside. <br>
Index 1 - 19 will be in the Events column. <br>

Index 36 - 51 will be in the Basic Task column.
